    "Programme specific goals for learning outcome": "A Master of Science in Engineering (Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence)\n* can delimit a complex open issue and select technological solution options in relation to data, software, interaction and computer graphics\n* can conceptualize, design, implement and validate software solutions\n* can model and design interaction between humans and computer systems\n* can apply elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning\n* can apply visual computing in the development of digital media products\n* can combine technological and commercial knowledge for the design of digital media products\n* can incorporate elements of new research in the future development of innovative digital media products\n* can model user needs hierarchically as outcomes, activites and prioritized tasks and apply lean methods to iteratively validate solutions based on rapid prototyping\n* can develop business models to optimize value in digital media products\n* can formulate quantitative models and use them to solve technological issues in relation to data, software, interaction and computer graphics\n* can apply a high level programming language (e.g. Python) to utilize web APIs for data acquisition\n* can apply algorithms to recommend media (text, audio, video) according to user preferences and user context (friends, mood, location, etc).",
    "Structure": "The MSc Eng programme is a research-based technological programme at the elite level aimed at qualifying the graduate for a knowledge-intensive position in the industry, the business sector and society in general. Graduates obtain the title of Master of Science in Engineering in the given engineering field\nThe MSc Eng has a workload of 120 ECTS credit points. **From September 2023** the programmes comprise four categories of courses: The Polytechnical foundation, Programme-specific courses, Elective courses and Master's thesis. If students choose more than the required credits in the groups with mandatory courses, the credits count as elective courses.\n**The Polytechnical foundation** The polytechnical foundation of the MSc programme ensures that you learn computational models for creating sustainable solutions. You will also acquire knowledge about innovation processes - including teamwork, entrepreneurship, and business acumen - all related to specific academic or interdisciplinary contents in your study programme.\n**Programme-specific courses** The programme-specific courses ensure that you gain an understanding of the core elements in your subject area and that you acquire the latest technological knowledge and competencies in your subject area.\n**Elective courses** The Elective courses include all MSc courses at DTU and similar courses at other universities if these courses have been pre-approved. They provide an opportunity for master students to either focus even more on their chosen area of specialization or supplement the academic specialization with general disciplines/competencies. Master students may choose as many as 10 credit points among the bachelor courses at DTU and courses at an equivalent level from other higher institutions. Master students may also choose as many as 10 credit points within the [general engineering courses category](http://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/regler/regler-for-merit/merit-under-uddannelsen) (meaning courses that do not have technical-scientific content but fall within the learning objectives of the study programme). However, bachelor courses and general engineering courses may not exceed 10 credit points in total.\n**Master Thesis** The Master Thesis is the final project of the course of study. In many cases, it will be possible for the Master Thesis to include collaboration with a company. The Master Thesis must, at minimum, equal 30 ECTS credit points, but may be 32½ or 35 ECTS credit points. Please read the chapter “Master Thesis” for more information.\n**Specializations** Within an MSc programme, there might be one or more Specializations. A specialization is merely a suggested combination of courses geared towards a specific aspect of a discipline. The specialization title will - when approved by the head of studies - be added to the diploma.\n**Before 2023** the categories of the Polytechnical Foundation and Programme-specific courses were not part of the structure. Instead, it comprised of the categories of General Competence courses and Technological specialization courses.\n**General competence courses** The General competence courses have a broader scope than the specialist competencies. The primary purpose is to ensure that a series of competencies – in association with the individual specialization – are obtained by all candidates. The following three considerations must be emphasized:\n* A generalist point of view, where technology is combined with economics, management, organization and project work, and where the key is to have a technical approach in a commercial and societal perspective\n* A synthesis point of view concentrating on working with an open problem where teamwork and cooperation, especially interdisciplinary work, are a key element\n* Normative technical skills that formulate a common academic identity for the degree program and/or indicate the academic point of departure and level of the program\n\n\nThe polytechnic holistic competencies that are cited as one of the two central objectives for the MSc program can be obtained in many ways, but the contents of the study program’s General Competencies outlined here ensure that the central aspects of these competencies are part of the course of study, depending on how the Technological specialization courses and the MSc thesis are undertaken.\n**Technological specialization courses** The Technological specialization courses and MSc Thesis together represent the basic foundation for achieving cutting-edge academic competencies. The Technological specifializaion courses are dynamic and will constantly reflect (potential) technological developments.",
    "Programme provision": "To obtain the MSc degree in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, the student must fulfil the following requirements:\n* Have passed Polytechnical foundation courses adding up to at least 10 ECTS\n* Have passed Programme-specific courses adding up to at least 50 ECTS\n* Have performed a Master Thesis of 30 ECTS points within the field of the general program\n* Have passed a sufficient number of Elective courses to bring the total number of ECTS of the entire study to 120 ECTS",
    "Specializations": "The master program has a number of specializations, which are merely recommended ways of choosing the courses in the curriculum. Applicants are not admitted to a specialization but to the programme and it is possible to choose among all the courses in the curriculum following the directions given. If a specialization has been fulfilled the title of the specialization may be added to the diploma.\nThe program contains the following specialization:\n* [AI and Cognition](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/specialization/ai-and-cognition)\n* [Machine Learning at Scale](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/specialization/machine-learning-at-scale)\n* [Data Science](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/specialization/data-science)\n* [Human-Computer Interaction](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/specialization/human-computer-interaction)\n* [Visual Computing](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/specialization/visual-computing)\n* [Computer Games](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/specialization/computer-games)\n\n\n\"AI and Cognition\" focuses on advanced machine learning and statistics as well as artificial intelligence and human cognition, aiming at developing artificial intelligent systems and/or modelling human interaction and behaviour.\n\"Machine Learning at Scale\" focuses on efficiently designing and implementing machine learning algorithms and systems and on methods for analysing data.\n”Data Science” is centred around development of services that enable modelling of user behavior based on raw text and images from social media or retrieved from contextually data generated by wearables and smartphones, and on methods to analyze, gain insights from, and possibly react to data arising from human activities.\n\"Human-Computer Interaction\" is focused in general on agile prototyping of novel types of interfaces supporting the interaction between people and software, based on human centred design and the overall user experience, and with elements of cognitive modeling. This may more specifically, but is not limited to, be focused towards applications in digital and mobile health, or it may involve individuals applying empirical methods and active/passive sensing, allowing them to observe phenomena of personal relevance with the aim to explore personal questions, to reason and learn from personal data with consequential benefits for daily living, quality of life, and well-being.\n\"Visual Computing\" can involve inferring 3D structures from camera geometry ranging from robotics to augmented reality (vision) or it can be focused on 3D modeling, rendering and animation (graphics).\n\"Computer Games\" incorporates more aspects related to both sound design and prototype development of games, which makes it possible to participate in the cross-disciplinary [DADIU](http://dadiu.dk/) program centred around games production in collaboration with students from a.o. University of Copenhagen, Aalborg University, The National Film School of Denmark and Danish Design School.\nNOTES: Only one specialization can be on the diploma. Students are free to combine the recommended courses from the areas above according to their desired profile, and/or choose to include competences in specific areas of their interest; however a specialization can only be added to the diploma if the requirements are fulfilled for the chosen specialization.\nThe specializations are additionally described in more detail at the [program homepage](http://studieinformation.dtu.dk/english/master-of-science-in-engineering/human-centered-artificial-intelligence/focus-areas).\n_Specializations are merely recommended ways of choosing the courses in the curriculum. Applicants are not admitted to a specialization but to the programme and it is possible to choose among all the courses in the curriculum following the directions given.

The objective of the master's thesis is to give students the opportunity to independently apply the knowledge they have acquired to a larger project that concludes with a written report. The thesis must document skills in applying scientific theories and methodologies to a clearly defined academic topic.\nIt is also possible to do an entrepreneurial thesis with a supervisor or co-supervisor from the Centre for Technology Entrepreneurship. Read more about the content and how to apply on their website: [https://www.entrepreneurship.dtu.dk/education](http://www.entrepreneurship.dtu.dk/education)\n**Prerequisites for starting a master’s thesis** The master’s thesis can only be commenced when the student lacks no more than 15 ECTS credits besides the thesis.\nIf the student wishes to start their master's thesis at an earlier stage, they must submit an application to DTU’s Board of Exemptions. The application must be accompanied by an academically justified statement from the main supervisor and a statement from the Head of Studies. Read more about submitting an application at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exemption](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exemption)'. If the student begins their master's thesis without all prerequisites being met and without an exemption being granted, the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs may choose to cancel the student's project report in the system.\n**The content and learning objectives of the thesis** The content of the thesis is to be agreed upon with a supervisor. Find more information on the supervisor below in the section ‘’ _The supervisor_ ’.\nThe thesis may contain a combination of experimental work, fieldwork, theoretical studies, synthesis, modelling, and analysis. All theses must include elements of literature studies and criticism. In addition, the thesis contains the following overarching learning objectives:\nA graduate of the MSc programme from DTU**:**\n* can identify and reflect on technical scientific issues and understand the interaction between the various components that make up an issue\n* can, based on a clear academic profile, apply elements of current research at an international level to develop ideas and solve problems\n* masters technical scientific methodologies, theories, and tools, and can take a holistic view of and delimit a complex, open issue, put it into a broader academic and societal perspective, and, on this basis, propose a variety of possible actions while considering sustainability\n* can develop relevant models, systems, technologies, and processes aimed at solving technological problems\n* can communicate and mediate research-based knowledge both orally and in writing\n* is familiar with and can seek out leading international research within their specialist area.\n* can work independently and reflect on own learning, academic development, and specialization\n* masters technical problem-solving at a high level through cross-disciplinary teamwork, and can work with and manage all phases of a project – including preparation of timetables, design, solution, and documentation\n\n\nFurther learning objectives exist for the entrepreneurial thesis: [https://www.entrepreneurship.dtu.dk/education](http://www.entrepreneurship.dtu.dk/education)\n**The supervisor** A master's thesis agreement must be concluded between the student and a supervisor, and it must be done well in advance of the starting day of the thesis. The main supervisor for a master's thesis must\n* be an employee at DTU as a VIP with research obligations and one of the following job categories: assistant professor, associate professor, researcher, senior researcher, senior adviser, or professor,\n* hold a permanent position (with the exception of assistant professors and researchers)\n* have completed DTU's course ['Supervision of larger projects at DTU'](https://learninglab.dtu.dk/english/University-Teaching-UDTU/pedagogical_workshops/Supervision-of-larger-projects-at-DTU) or similar pedagogical competence development at the university level e.g. a course in PhD supervision; for assistant professors, however, it is sufficient that one is in the process of UDTU, and\n* have in-depth knowledge of the study conditions at DTU.\n\n\nFor  _assistant professors and researchers_ , however, there is an additional requirement that an associate professor, senior researcher, senior adviser, or a professor (docent, ingeniørdocent or professor) must be connected to the project as co-supervisor, so that the assistant professor/researcher does not have sole responsibility for the project.\nThe head of department can approve that a VIP who for a number of years has gained extensive experience in supervising final projects can be the primary supervisor without having completed the course 'Supervision of major projects at DTU' or equivalent.\nThe supervisor must confirm that the student has the requisite academic qualifications for undertaking the master's thesis. The student must document their qualifications and level in the form of a list of courses they have completed.\nThe supervisor must regularly follow the progress of the thesis and ensure that the master's thesis falls within the academic focus area of the MSc programme.\n**Start time for the master’s thesis** In general, the thesis must be started following the previous study activity (a course).\nAlternate start dates may apply for academic reasons and if the supervisor approves. Students and thesis supervisors may always agree on earlier start dates. For a delayed start, the project registration must always contain a justification for the delayed start.\nIn determining the project's start date, the supervisor's 3-week summer vacation in June, July, or August must be taken into account so as not to come into conflict with the 10-day deadline of the oral defence, cf. below under ‘ _Assessment and examination_ ’. The project plan should also reflect this.\n**Project agreement and volume** The master's thesis must have a scope equivalent to 30, 32½, or 35 ECTS credits. It is not possible to get an exemption for a thesis larger than 35 ECTS credits.\nThe project period should be specified in connection with the formulation of a project agreement.\nA master's thesis must be undertaken as a full-time course of study, and the stipulated time is:\n* 30 ECTS credits = 5 months\n* 32½ ECTS credits = 5½ months\n* 35 ECTS credits = 6 months\n\n\nSpecific rules apply for the **Industry** MSc Eng Programmes. These programmes combine work with studies and are part-time studies.\nTherefore their master's thesis may be undertaken as a part-time course of study and the stipulated time is\n* 30 ECTS credits = 10 months\n* 32½ ECTS credits =11 months\n* 35 ECTS credits =12 months\n\n\nThe master's thesis must be written in English and include an abstract. As an exemption, the supervisor of the master's thesis can decide that the thesis may be written in Danish. This decision can only be made due to professional, academic reasons. The Head of Studies for the study programme must accept this exemption.\nThe master's thesis may be prepared either individually or as a group project with a maximum of four students.\nThe master's thesis may be undertaken in collaboration with a company. Find more information regarding projects in cooperation with a company at student.dtu.dk under [‘Study rules’/’Teaching’/’Project courses’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/project-courses).\nThe master's thesis may be prepared abroad if the general requirements are met. The supervisor, also being the examiner of the project, still has to be an employee at DTU. The external examiner has to be appointed by the Corps of External Examiners for the engineering programmes ([www.censornet.dk](http://www.censornet.dk)).\nFormalities regarding report length, content, structure, and duration of the oral defence, etc., are agreed upon between the student and the main supervisor. In the event of disagreement, the board of studies at the department where the main supervisor is employed may be involved.\nThe student's agreement with the supervisor must be reported by the supervisor in the Project Reporting System well in advance of the start of the project. Upon registration, the Head of Studies is automatically informed of the thesis and can, within 14 days, reject the project if this does not fall within the programme’s technical and scientific field. The student will be contacted if the project cannot be approved. Notwithstanding the academic approval, however, the project work must not start until the student receives an e-mail with the approved project agreement from the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs. This also applies if the master's thesis is completed in whole or in part outside DTU.\n**Project period _Before the project period_** The master's thesis agreement is binding and counts as an examination attempt from the time when the master's thesis, according to the agreement, begins. The master's thesis agreement may be cancelled until the start date of the master's thesis, in which case it will not count as an exam attempt.\nAs a general rule, no parallel activities should be conducted in this period. Nevertheless, the period can be extended with 3 weeks of study for every 5 additional ECTS credits from course activity, if the extended period is registered before the official start date of the project.\nThe project period can also be extended by up to 3 weeks due to documented impairment, if the extended period is registered before the official start date of the project. If the project is carried out as a group project, this extension will be given to all group members. Read more about this on student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Special Exam Arrangements](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/special-exam-arrangements)'. If the project is carried out as a group project, any extension of the project period will apply to all group members. The project supervisor allocates the extra time when the project is reported in the Project Reporting System.\nWhen determining the project's start date, the supervisor's 3-week summer vacation in June, July, or August must be taken into account to avoid conflicting with the 10-day deadline for holding the oral defence, cf. below under ‘ _Assessment and examination_ ’. The project plan should also reflect this.\n**_After the start of the project_** During the project period, the supervisor may extend the project by one week for every course the student plans to complete as a re-exam during the project period. The student must present documentation fore registration for the re-exam to the supervisor. The supervisor must register the new deadline of the project in the project registration system.\nAn extension of the submission deadline for the project must be noted in the final version of the project plan. That applies to all types of extensions of the submission deadline.\n**_Project plan_** During the first month, the student is to submit/upload a project plan to the thesis, outlining the objective of the thesis. In the project plan, the student is also to take into account the overarching learning objectives listed under _\"The content and the learning objectives of the thesis\"_.\nThe student receives an autogenerated email with information about the submission deadline for the project plan, just as there is a link to an overview of all the student's submissions at student.dtu.dk ('My assignments'). Upload takes place via the group created for the master’s thesis. In the project plan, the student is also to take into account the overarching learning objectives listed above.\nWhen submitting the thesis, the student is to enclose a separate document presenting the original project plan and a revision of the same, where appropriate. In addition, the document is to include a brief auto-evaluation of the project process.\n**_Extension of the project period via the Board of Studies - up to six weeks_** If there are extraordinary, unforeseen circumstances in relation to the project (e.g. in relation to collaboration with a company, change of supervisor, extraordinary technical problems) or in relation to the student's situation (e.g. illness, death in close family, maternity leave), the Department Board of Studies has the opportunity to grant from one up to six weeks extension of the project period. Project extension must always be supported in writing by the main supervisor.\nThe student must submit an application to the Department Board of Studies where the main supervisor is employed. The application must be accompanied by documentation of the special circumstances (e.g. a medical certificate) and a revised project plan stating when the extraordinary circumstances occurred. An overview of the chairmen of the department board of studies can be found at student.dtu.dk under '[Campus and study environment/Committees and boards/Study boards'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/study-environment/udvalg-og-naevn/institutstudienaevn).\nThe application should be submitted as early as possible. The application deadline is important in view of the Board of Studies' ability to process the application before the applicable submission deadline.\nIf the student's application is approved, it is the responsibility of the Board of Studies/main supervisor to change the submission deadline for the project in the Project Reporting System. If the project extension extends beyond the student's maximum duration of the study programme, the project extension takes precedence. If the application is not accepted, the student has the opportunity to submit an application to the Board of Exemptions according to the procedure below.\n**_Extension of the project period via the Board of Exemptions - beyond six weeks_** An application for an extension of the project period beyond six weeks will, in principle, not be granted, and the student is referred to use a further exam attempt.\nIf the student can document that there are such unusual circumstances that the project period should be extended beyond six weeks, and this is supported in writing by the main supervisor, who believes that the project can withstand this postponement, the student can submit an exemption application to the Board of Exemptions (CMDU).\nExemption is applied for at [www.dispensation.dtu.dk](http://www.dispensation.dtu.dk/). The application must be submitted no later than one month before the applicable submission deadline for the project unless the special circumstances are urgent and could not have been foreseen at an earlier time. The application deadline is important in view of the Board of Exemptions' ability to process the application before the applicable submission deadline. The rules for submitting an exemption application are described in more detail at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exemption](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exemption)'.\n_**Illness during the project period**_ Students who become ill during the project period but before the submission deadline for the project can apply for an extension of the project period via the above options with the department board of studies or the Board of Exemptions.\nThe student can also apply for a leave of absence during the project period. Read more at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Leave of absence'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/leave-of-absence)\n**_Commencement of a new project with a new project period_** If the student wishes to abandon his/her thesis and start over within a different field of study with a new deadline (5, 5½, or 6 months), this must be approved by the (new) supervisor. The (new) supervisor must inform the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs and the Head of Studies whereafter a new project agreement must be made within the new field of study and with a new ordinary deadline (5, 5½ or 6 months). However, the student will have used one examination attempt on the abandoned project which will get the registration EM (not met). It is the student's responsibility to inform the former supervisor that he/she abandons the thesis.\n**Deadline** Failure to meet the deadline means the student will have used an exam attempt. The student and the supervisor must then make a new project agreement for the thesis but with a modified thesis statement within the same field. The new thesis must be submitted within 3 months of approval of the project. This procedure also applies if the student fails his/her exam. If the student wishes to reuse already submitted elements or larger parts of the project, this must be clearly stated in the project, as otherwise there will be self-plagiarism and thus a violation of the rules for the exam. Read more at student.dtu.dk under [Study rules/Exam/Cheating at exams and other forms of assessment](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/cheating-at-exams-and-other-forms-of-assessment).\n**Submission of the master's thesis** The master's thesis must be submitted electronically. The student automatically receives an email with information about the submission deadline for the project, just as there is a link to an overview of all the student's submissions at student.dtu.dk ('My assignments'). Submission takes place via the group that has been created for the master's thesis.\n**Illness after the submission but before the oral defence** A student who becomes ill during the period from the submission of the project to the oral defence or on the day of the defence must inform the supervisor about this as soon as possible. If the student sends documentation of the illness to their main supervisor within 14 days from the original scheduled oral defence date, a new date for the oral defense can be agreed upon, without this counting as a new exam attempt.\n**Assessment and examination** Learning objectives are an integrated part of the supervision.\nThe master’s thesis is assessed according to the 7-point grading scale with an external examination based on the report and an oral defence with the participation of the supervisor, any co-supervisors, and an external examiner appointed by the Civil Engineering Corps of External Examiners. This also applies to projects fully or partially completed abroad.\nThe evaluation of the report and the oral defence are based on an overall assessment. A submitted report without an oral defence is assessed with 'Not met' (EM).\nWhen assessing a master's thesis, the main focus is on the academic content. The student's formulation and spelling ability count for a small but nonetheless significant weight of the assessment. DTU can grant exemptions for students who document a relevant disability.\nIf more than one student writes the thesis, each student will be examined individually. However, the assessment of group projects may also include a group exam with the participation of the entire group. In this case, the individual oral exams are carried out after the completion of the group exam. In addition to the examinee themselves, only those group members who have already been examined themselves may be present. A student in a group project always has the right to deselect a group exam. In that case, the duration of the individual exam must be adjusted accordingly.\nIn consultation with the student, the supervisor will set a date for the oral presentation and defence.\nThe oral defence must be held no later than ten work days after the scheduled submission date of the thesis. In exceptional circumstances, the head of department can approve a later exam date. If the project period has been extended after the start of the project as a result of the Board of Studies’ or the exemption committee's decision, the 10-day deadline must, as far as possible, continue to be complied with. A later exam date due to the changed conditions, e.g. due to the supervisor's 3-week holiday in June, July or August, can be determined without approval from the head of department. Find more information on student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules/Exam/Deadlines for grading](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/deadlines-for-grading)'.\nThe oral defence of projects carried out in a company may, due to company secrets referred to in the project, be held behind closed doors by agreement with the supervisor.

    "Study Activity Requirements and Deadlines": "**Programme Deadlines** Students must meet the study activity requirements and deadlines set out below. If students do not meet the requirements, they can only continue on the study programme if granted an exemption.\n**Study Activity Requirement of 5 ECTS** Students must have passed at least 5 ECTS credits in a continuous period of one year, calculated in two full semesters, to comply with DTU's 5-point study activity requirement. It is of no importance in this context how many exam attempts the student has used.\n**Maximum Duration of Study** The MSc programme is a two-year programme. The entire MSc course of study must be completed no later than three years after admission.\nThe **Industry** MSc Eng Programmes are four-year programmes. The entire Industry MSc Eng course of study must be completed within five years.\nThe maximum duration of study is reduced by one semester for every 30 ECTS credits the student has been granted in pre-commencement credit transfer.\n**Completion Requirements** The student must earn 120 ECTS under one of DTU’s MSc programmes to earn an MSc degree. The courses and the thesis must be passed.\n**Completion Guidelines for Late Students** If students exceed the prescribed period of study by 6-12 months, they will be offered special guidance in the form of an information meeting. If students are more than 12 months late, they will be offered a personal guidance interview with a study counsellor.\n**SU** (State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme) Students must be aware that the above requirements and deadlines are DTU's study rules.

Pure online courses are not allowed unless they are part of an international collaboration to offer online courses or are offered as part of Digital Twin University (D.T.U.).\n**_Language of teaching_** BEng and BSc courses are usually taught in Danish. A limited number of courses can be offered in English on other BSc and BEng programmes. Courses on the English-language BSc programme in General Engineering are offered in English.\nAll MSc courses are taught in English.\n**_The academic year_** The academic year is divided into six teaching periods:\n* Two 13-week periods in the autumn and spring semesters.\n* Four 3-week periods followed by exams in January, June, July, and August.\n\n\nIn addition, there are\n* Three exam periods (May, August, and December).\n\n\nThe order and scheduling of mandatory courses, academic content, teaching and working methods, and any prerequisites are specified in the programme specifications for each study programme and the individual course descriptions. Mandatory study elements can generally not be taught in July/August exclusively.\n**_Public lectures_** Lectures at DTU are generally open to the public. However, a lecturer can deny access to the public due to considerations of space or order and can hence reject listeners who are not registered for the course. Only students registered for the course may participate actively in the class.\n_**Recording of teaching**_ If a student wishes to do a sound or video recording of teaching sessions at DTU, the lecturer must approve this in writing before the recording. Recordings are only for personal use unless the lecturer has allowed publication of the recording, including what kind of publication. Only the teaching itself must be admitted, not fellow students' comments during instruction unless they have also consented to the admission.\nAs for the possibilities for the lecture to record/stream the teaching, information can be found at [panopto.dtu.dk](http://panopto.dtu.dk/Panopto/Pages/Home.aspx) and at [student.dtu.dk](http://student.dtu.dk/kurser-og-undervisning/video-i-undervisningen).",

This means that a student cannot be allowed to register for courses that in the course database are registered as not applicable to courses that the student has already passed or is bound by, and these courses block each other. Not applicable courses do not mean, per definition, that the courses are identical. The Study Administration can inform whether non-applicable courses are identical.\nIf the student cannot find the above information in the course description, the course coordinator and/or the relevant chairman of the department board of studies can be contacted. An overview of the chairmen of the board of studies at the individual departments can be found at student.dtu.dk under ' [Campus and study environment/Committees and boards/Study boards'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/study-environment/udvalg-og-naevn/institutstudienaevn).\n_**Changes to course descriptions**_ Significant changes to the course descriptions must be available no later than:\n* 25 June for the 13-week period in autumn\n* 1 November for the 3-week period in January\n* 25 November for the 13-week period in spring\n* 15 April for the 3-week periods in June, July, and August.\n\n\nIn exceptional cases, significant changes can be made after the abovementioned deadlines during the teaching period. This has to be approved by the course coordinator, the department board of studies, and the students.\nThe following procedure applies in case of significant changes to the course description after the above deadlines:\n1. Proposed changes must be formulated in writing and sent to the department board of studies for approval.\n2. If approved, the proposal is sent as a bulletin via DTU Learn to all registered students. The bulletin must clearly state that the change is a proposal that will be implemented unless one or more students raise objections. Students are given at least 14 days to object to the change.\n3. If no objections are received, the course coordinator posts a new bulletin announcing that no objections have been raised against the change, and the change will hereby be adopted.\n\n\nThe course coordinator/the board of studies updates approved changes in the course descriptions on DTU’s website, [www.kurser.dtu.dk](http://www.kurser.dtu.dk/).",

No lecturer or professor can register/enroll a student for a course.\nStudents must be registered for a course to attend classes—including laboratory exercises—participate in group work, and obtain course information and teaching material (notes, etc.) via DTU Learn. Students not registered for the course can contact the lecturer to access the course group. Still, access to this group does _not_ entitle the student to hand in assignments or participate in the exam.\n_**Course registration in the first semester**_ BEng and BSc students are automatically registered for courses in the first teaching period (13-week period) in the first semester of their study programme. Students must register for all other courses through the [Study Planner](http://studieplan.dtu.dk/).\nMSc students and visiting students must register for courses through the Study Planner.\nNew MSc students and visiting students must confirm that they accept DTU’s code of honour to be able to register for courses via the Study Planner. See also at [student.dtu.dk under ‘Exam/Exam cheating/DTU's code of honour’.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/eksamenssnyd/dtu-code-of-honour)\n_**Course registration in other semesters**_ Students are responsible for ensuring that their course registrations have been registered correctly in their study plan and that registration for the courses has been made within the applicable registration and withdrawal deadlines.\nRegistration and withdrawal deadlines for courses can be found at [student.dtu.dk under 'Courses and teaching/Course registration and withdrawal/Course registration deadlines'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/courses-and-teaching/course-registration/course-registration-deadlines).\nIn the supplementary course registration period, a decision on limited admission to a course can be made on the grounds of the capacity of facilities or academic reasons. See student.dtu.dk under [‘Participation in limited admission courses’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/participation-in-limited-admission-courses) under ‘Teaching’. Therefore, students must be aware that participation in a course may not be possible if the student registers for the course in the supplementary course registration period, even if limited admission is not noted in the course description.\n**_Registration for final projects, internships, and special courses_** Students cannot register for final projects, internships, or special courses themselves. Registration takes place via the Project Reporting System, and the supervisor of the final project and special courses and the internship supervisor can register students via this system. Once the supervisor has registered the activity in the project reporting system, the student will receive an email in their study email when it is approved. Once a project is finally approved, it will appear in the Study Planner as an exam registration during the exam period and not as a course registration during the teaching period.\n**_Registration for courses under the transitional procedure for the master's programme_** Information on how to register for courses under the transitional procedure can be found at student.dtu.dk under [Study rules/Transferring to an MSc programme.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/transferring-to-msc-programme)\n_**Rules for choice of courses**_ Students cannot register for a course they have already passed. A course has been passed if the grade 02 or the assessment ‘Pass’ has been awarded. Reregistrations for passed courses will be rejected.\nStudents can register for courses that form part of their curriculum. All other courses must be pre-approved by the Head of Study before registration. The Head of Study shall send this approval to the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs via email: studadm@adm.dtu.dk.\nBSc students may have as many as 10 ECTS credits at the BEng level as part of the Elective Courses in their bachelor's programme.\nMSc students may have as many as 10 ECTS credits at the BSc level. MSc students are not allowed to register for BEng courses. Neither the Head of Studies nor the Board of Exemptions can exempt from this.\nSome courses are only provided for students in selected study programmes. That will be stated in the course description. Students who do not attend these study programmes will not be granted access to the course. Students are not allowed to register for courses beyond the number of ECTS credits required by the programme and must plan their studies according to the prescribed number of ECTS credits for the programme. Student may register for courses as single subjects, but not for courses that are part of their programme specification or have been approved by the head of studies as part of the programme. Student may register for courses as single subjects if there is no room for the course within the current programme framework. Student should also be aware that courses taken as single subjects while enrolled in a full-time programme at DTU cannot be credited towards this full-time programme at a later time.\nAlso, see student.dtu.dk under ‘[Study rules’/‘Credit transfer’/‘Credit transfer during the study programme’.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/credit-transfer-studying-abroad/credit-transfer-during-the-study-programme)\n**_Elective courses_** _BEng students_ In the BEng programme, lists of optional courses that the student can freely choose from are available in the individual curricula, and all the courses have already been pre-approved by the head of studies. If a student wants to take a BEng or BSc course that is not on the list, it must be approved in advance by the head of studies. Documentation for the head of study's approval must be sent to the Study Administration. MSc courses may not be taken. Exceptions are MSc courses pre-approved for inclusion at the bachelor's level in the individual BEng programme. These courses will appear in the curriculum.\n_BSc students enrolled in study programmes/curricula valid _before_ September 2023_ In the BSc programme, the student can choose freely from all courses at DTU at the bachelor's and master's levels. It is also possible to choose from all BEng courses, but these may not exceed 10 ECTS credits in total. Courses cannot be taken at PhD level.\nBoth BEng and BSc students enrolled in study programmes valid before September 2023 who are bound by a master's course they have not passed can request to be released from the course by writing to studiedispensation@adm.dtu.dk via their student email with a reason and stating which other course they wish to take instead.

It is also possible to choose from all BEng courses, but these may not exceed 10 ECTS credits in total. MSc courses may not be taken. Exceptions are master's courses that by the Head of Studies are pre-approved for inclusion at the bachelor's level in the individual BSc programme. These courses will appear in the curriculum.\n_MSc students_ In the MSc programme, all courses at the master's and PhD levels at DTU are pre-approved. All bachelor's courses at DTU will also be pre-approved but may not exceed 10 ECTS credits in total. MSc students are not allowed to take courses at the BEng level. Neither the Head of Studies nor the Board of Exemptions can exempt from this.\n_Courses outside DTU_ : The rules for this are specified at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Credit transfer/'Credit transfer during the study programme'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/credit-transfer-studying-abroad/credit-transfer-during-the-study-programme)\n**Students who have completed MSc courses on their Beng or BSc programme** MSc students who, as part of their qualifying BEng or BSc education, have passed a course corresponding to courses in either the general competence group or the technological specialization group for the MSc programme must take a different course that contributes to the overall learning outcomes of the programme in question. That also applies if the student otherwise has acquired academic knowledge and competencies.\n_DTU courses_ If the course belongs to the _general competence group_ , students must choose a different course from the general competence group (GC) or the technological specialization group (TS). In the latter case, students must contact the Study Administration via studadm@adm.dtu.dk. An approval from the head of studies must be attached, after which the student can take a TS course instead of the GR course, which the student has passed on his/her BEng or BSc programme.\nIf the course belongs to the _technological specialization group or are programme specific courses_ , students must choose a different course in that group.\n_Non-DTU courses_ If it is not possible to choose a different course in line with the above rules or if the course is not from DTU, students must obtain approval from the head of studies to take another course  _that supports the academic profile of the study programme._ The head of studies contacts the Study Administration. When in doubt about the programme level of the course or the conversion of the credits from abroad to ECTS credits, the head of studies or the student is welcome to contact merit@adm.dtu.dk.\n_**Cancellation of courses**_ A non-mandatory course may be cancelled if fewer than ten students have registered. Other rules for minimum participation must be specified in the course description.\nMandatory courses and courses from the mandatory groups cannot be cancelled. With only a few registered, the course coordinator can, with the approval of the Department Board of Studies, decide that the course is run in an alternative way, e.g. as a study group. Questions about this should be directed to the course coordinator.\nA student bound to a course can be released from the binding if the course is cancelled during the teaching period in which the student had planned to take the course or the student has lost a draw. Requests to be released from the course must be made via e-mail to studadm@adm.dtu.dk and must be submitted in the same semester as the course has been cancelled. However, the student must still observe the curriculum of the study programme.

    "Binding courses": "If the student does not withdraw from their first exam attempt in a course before the deadline, it will count as a used exam attempt. That means the course is binding and becomes part of the student’s programme specification, cf. the rules for registration and withdrawal from exams on student.dtu.dk under [Study rules/Exam'/'Registration and withdrawal](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/registration-and-withdrawal). The student must pass the course to complete their programme.\nIn the case of documented illness at the first examination attempt in the course and the subsequent registration 'ill', the student is no longer bound by the course. However, students must still ensure they follow the study plan outlined in their curriculum.\nOn student.dtu.dk, under '[Study rules'/'Exemption](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exemption)', you can read about the possibility of applying for cancellation of an exam registration if the student has not participated in the exam and about the rules of applying for an exemption to be released from a binding course.\nStudents can find the exam registration and deregistration deadlines on student.dtu.dk under [Exam/Registration and withdrawal from exam/Registration and withdrawal deadlines](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-registration/tilmeldingsfrister).\nThe rules regarding when an exam attempt has been used can be found on student.dtu.dk under [Study rules/Exam/Assessment form and Gradings](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/assessment-forms-and-grading).\nSpecial rules apply to project courses. More information is available at student.dtu.dk under [Study rules/Teaching/Project courses](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/project-courses).\nStudents cannot take pre-approved or credit-transferred courses to replace one or more courses they are bound by. The head of studies cannot grant the student an exemption from this rule.\nBoth BEng and BSc students enrolled in study programmes valid before September 2023 who are bound by a master's course they have not passed can request to be released from the course by writing to studiedispensation@adm.dtu.dk via their student email with a reason and stating which other course they wish to take instead. The student must register for the new course.\n_**Courses no longer offered**_ If a course is no longer offered, a student who has exam attempts in the course but has not passed the course will be released from the course by contacting the Study Administration via student email to studadm@adm.dtu.dk. That applies regardless of how many examination attempts the student has used in the course and whether a re-exam is still offered in the course. Used exam attempts are not transferred to a new course unless the terminated course is identical to a new course the student registers for. Read about 'blocked courses' at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Regarding course descriptions](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/regarding-course-descriptions)'.\nHowever, the student must still observe the curriculum of the study programme. If the terminated course is compulsory in the curriculum, the student will be bound by the course that replaces it, and the exam attempts are transferred if the two courses are identical (cf. above). If it is not stated in the curriculum which course the student must take as a replacement for a discontinued compulsory course, the Head of Study must be contacted.\nThe above also includes courses that get a new course number but are actually offered again, merely with a new course number.\nRead about the option for being released from a binding course if the course is cancelled at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Course registration'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/course-registration).",

They must, therefore, provide thorough instructions. If a student fails to understand the safety instructions and/or does not follow the lecturer's instructions, the lecturer may dismiss the student from the class. Read more about disciplinary actions for students on student.dtu.dk under ‘[Study rules’/'Disciplinary measures](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/disciplinary-measures)'.\n_**Mandatory prerequisites**_ Mandatory prerequisite courses are only used if a course must be passed for security reasons or similar weighty reasons before participation in a subsequent course. Students may only register for the course and, if relevant, take part in a drawing of lots if they have passed or registered for the exam in the mandatory course.\n_**Academic prerequisites**_ Recommended academic prerequisite courses form the basis for the teaching, and students are expected to know about the topics covered by the courses. Students may enroll in courses with academic prerequisites that they have not yet passed, but if the student does not meet the necessary prerequisites, they are not entitled to special academic counselling and may be dismissed from the student's presence is inconvenient to the general teaching.",

It is stated in the course description if there is a participant restriction in a course. During the post-enrollment period for courses, participants may be restricted to a course based on room capacity or academic conditions.\n** _Guidelines for fully booked courses_** If a course is fully booked, the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs will draw lots among the registered students to determine who gets to participate. No later than one month before the start of the teaching period, a study announcement will be sent out with information about the procedure for drawing lots in the event of fully booked courses.\nAll students who have registered for a course for which participation will be determined by drawing lots will receive an email after the draw with status information. There are three status types:\n* Place on the course guaranteed\n* On the waiting list\n* Lost draw\n\n\n** _You can lose your place in a course with limited admission_** Students who have been granted a place in the course but who do not attend classes when the course starts and fail to notify and get approval from the lecturer of subsequent attendance will not be permitted to keep their place in an overbooked course after the dates stated below:\n13-week period: after the end of class on the first day of teaching in the course 3-week period: four hours after course commencement The place will be given to the next student present with the lowest number on the waiting list.\n_**Priority in case of drawing lots**_ The course description may state that students enrolled in specific study programmes have priority in a lot drawing. Students registered for a course within the deadline will be assigned a place or participate in drawing lots according to this priority. If nothing is stated in the course description, all full-time students registered within the deadline will participate equally in the draw.\n* In any drawing of lots, full-time students who have registered within the deadline and students on the flexible master’s programme (part-time programme) have priority over guest students and students on continuing education.\n* Students for whom the course is mandatory or forms part of one of the mandatory groups have priority over students for whom the course is not mandatory. If a student for whom a course forms a mandatory part of the programme loses a draw, the student in question will be guaranteed a place if he/she registers for the course the next time it is offered.\n* Guest students studying at DTU under one of DTU's international joint programmes and for whom the course constitutes a mandatory programme element or part of the mandatory group take precedence over full-time students for whom the course is not mandatory, as well as other guest students and part-time students.\n* Students enrolled on part-time programmes for whom a course constitutes a mandatory programme element take precedence over students in part-time programmes for whom the course is not mandatory.\n* Guest students and students in part-time programmes who register within the deadline will be assigned a place in overbooked courses and will have priority over full-time students who register after the deadline.\n\n\n_**Non-priority in case of drawing lots**_ The following situation is not a priority in the case of drawing lots:\n* Students bound to a course, cf. [the rules on binding courses,](http://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/regler/regler-for-undervisning/bindende-kurser) do not have priority in the case of drawing lots.

However, some courses (such as practical and laboratory courses) require active participation to pass the course. In courses with projects, giving presentations and acting as a critic regarding presentations given by other students may be mandatory. If class participation is mandatory, it must be specified in the course description.\n** _Mandatory exam prerequisite assignments etc._** A course coordinator may decide that the submission and approval of written assignments, oral presentations, etc., during the course are prerequisites for students to be allowed to take the course exam. This kind of assignment, etc., is called exam prerequisites. If a course has exam prerequisites, it must be stated in the course description.\nAn exam prerequisite must meet the course learning objectives in terms of form and content, and the course coordinator is expected to provide the students with some feedback. The individual course coordinators decide on the criteria for approval of the exam prerequisite and inform the students. Exam prerequisites are not included in the course assessment.\nIt counts as an exam attempt if the student does not meet any exam prerequisites and the deadline for registering for the exam has been exceeded.

If the lecturer requests, the student must be able to document the reason for being absent. If retaking the mandatory activity in the current semester is impossible, the student is entitled to take the activity again the next time the course is offered. If the student can document illness, they have the right only to retake the missing activities the next time teaching in the course is offered.\nIf the student cannot participate in the exam in the course due to a legitimate absence, the student must submit documentation for the reason for the absence. If the student does not submit documentation, the exam will count as an exam attempt.

    "Deadlines for publication of teaching material and syllabus": "Information about the course material for the first teaching session and the framework of the course (e.g. working method, expected meeting times, preparation for the first sessions, submission deadlines) must be available to the students on the course no later than one week before the start of the course.\nInformation about material forming part of the exam syllabus must be available on DTU Learn/student.dtu.dk no later than three weeks before the end of the teaching period, together with a description of the syllabus or other reading guidelines.",
    "Project courses": "The content of a project course is agreed upon between the student(s) and a DTU supervisor. The DTU supervisor registers the project course in the project registration system (Projektindberetningssystemet).\nThe supervisor for B Eng students must be an employee holding a permanent position at DTU; assistant professors are exempt from this.\nAs for BSc and MSc students, the supervisor must be a member of the scientific staff with research obligations and hold a permanent position at DTU (assistant professors exempted). An exemption from the requirement for research obligation may be granted by the relevant BSc or MSc Head of Studies.\nThe ECTS credit for a project course ranges from 5 to 30 ECTS credits with intervals of 2.5 credits. 5 ECTS credits correspond to around three weeks of full-time study. In exceptional cases, it is possible to take a project course corresponding to 2.5 ECTS credits, for example, if the course constitutes the final element of the programme. In such a case, the lecturer must contact the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs to register for the course.\nThe student must always be aware of whether there are restrictions in the curriculum for the student's field of study on how many ECTS credits can be used for project courses.\nThe project period for a project course cannot extend six months. The agreement regarding a project course is binding on both parties. Still, it can be changed according to an agreement between the parties. The project course must be documented in a report or similar.\nIf a student does not pass a project course, a re-exam of the course _can_ be offered. That is agreed upon between the supervisor and the student. In the event of a disagreement on whether a re-exam is to be held, the department board of studies must decide the case after an inquiry from the student or supervisor. The student can always plead for the right to three examination attempts in the course.\n_**Projects in cooperation with a company (project-based exams)**_ A project course can be carried out entirely or partially with a company in Denmark or abroad (called a project-based exam). The academic content, learning objectives, and the form of assessment and grading must be agreed upon with a DTU supervisor. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring the project has a sufficient academic/theoretical level. The ECTS credit total is based only on the expected project workload, which means that the duration of a possible internship with the company is not credit awarding.\nThe students are responsible for finding a company, but many departments have contact with several companies. Students can visit [DTU Career Hub](https://connect.jobteaser.com/?client_id=e500827d-07fc-4766-97b4-4f960a2835e7&entity_color=%2300892d&entity_logo=https%3A%2F%2Fd1guu6n8gz71j.cloudfront.net%2Fsystem%2Fasset%2Flogos%2F6704550%2Flogo.png%3F1674556979&entity_name=DTU+Career+Hub&nonce=a01941389e2fea326e9c0b5568e9b7f5&organization_domain=dtu&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdtu.jobteaser.com%2Fusers%2Fauth%2Fconnect%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=openid+email+profile+groups&state=8b8c2fe19082cbf2952ee80d90ea4dd1&ui_locales=da), a matchmaking site that makes it easier for businesses, students, and DTU employees to get in touch with each other.\nIn connection with an unpaid project-based course, BSc and MSc students may receive recognition from appreciation from the company of a maximum of DKK 3,286 a month (2022-level). It is voluntary for the company to give an acknowledgment. The acknowledgement is not granted as a predetermined income, which the student can expect to receive in the same way as a salary. The student must not be included as a labourer during his/her stay in the company.\n_Project proposals_ For student projects made in collaboration with a company, students are recommended to prepare a project proposal signed by the student, DTU supervisor, and the company, as all three parties must agree on the project.\nThe project proposal should describe the most important aspects of the project: project title, specific project tasks, expected work effort and meeting time, duration of the stay in the company, whether the student gets office space, what equipment is provided, etc.\nNo specific agreement must be made between DTU and the company regulating confidentiality and other aspects of the student project in connection with a student's project with a company. That is only relevant if students are part of DTU's research collaboration. See below.\n_Information about G-declaration in connection with DTU's research collaboration with a company_ If students are part of DTU's research collaboration with a company, the department must ensure that the student signs a declaration (\"G-declaration\") on confidentiality and rights transfer to DTU.\nThe declaration ensures that DTU can involve the student in the research project and still fulfil its duties towards DTU's partners.\nAll project partners must consent to DTU using the student to participate in the project work.\nEach department has a person responsible for contracts whom the DTU supervisor can contact to get a template for a G-declaration. The project supervisor can see an overview of persons responsible for contracts at each department on the employee pages at DTU Inside here: <https://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/medarbejder/forskning-innovation-og-raadgivning/forskningssamarbejde-jura-og-kontraktforhold/for-forskere>",
    "Evaluation of teaching": "At the end of the semester, the teaching in all courses is evaluated via student.dtu.dk. The students complete the evaluation forms anonymously. Evaluations are processed by the board of studies at the department.\nThe evaluation of a course comprises two forms:\n**Form A:** Evaluation of the course in general, including free-text proposals (text fields where students can give feedback in their own words) **Form B:** Evaluation of the course coordinator/lecturers _Form A_ is available to everyone regarding the answers to the questions. A summary of the course evaluations is published on [DTU's homepage.](http://evaluering.dtu.dk/CourseSearch)_Form B and the free-text proposals from Form A_ are confidential as they may contain sensitive personal information. The evaluations may, however, be accessed by the following persons:\n* The relevant head of department and managers with direct HR responsibility\n* All members of the relevant board of studies, including substitutes in the event of permanent members' absence\n* The course coordinator\n* When the course comprises a mandatory programme element, the relevant head of studies.\n\n\nComplaints regarding teaching and supervision\nStudents dissatisfied with the teaching in a given course or with the supervision received in connection with a project must contact the lecturer/supervisor concerned immediately to try to find a solution to the problem. If this does not solve the problem, the following rules for student complaints regarding teaching/supervision have been established:\n* The complaint should be submitted as soon as possible after a possible prior dialogue with the lecturer/supervisor and, as a general rule before the course is offered again.\n* Complaints must be justified in writing and submitted to the board of studies at the department offering the course. A list of study board chairpersons at the individual departments can be found on student.dtu.dk under[ ‘Campus and study environment/Committees and boards/Study boards’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/study-environment/udvalg-og-naevn/institutstudienaevn).\n* The department Board of Studies informs the Head of Department/closest manager about the complaint if the complaint concerns personnel issues. All or parts of the complaint will be processed by the Head of Department /closest manager who will decide on any official measures in relation to the teacher/supervisor if the complaint gives rise to it. The student must not be informed of anything other than that the case/parts of the case have been handed over to the Head of Department.\n* If the complaint does not relate to personnel matters, the department Board of Studies involves the lecturer/supervisor in the case. If the lecturer is not responsible for the course, the course coordinator must always be involved in the case. The Board of Studies is encouraged to anonymize the complainant's identity if it is not important for the processing of the case to know who the complainant is. In cases of a more personal nature, the student cannot remain anonymous to the lecturer/supervisor.\n* When the Board of Studies has dealt with the complaint, a reply must be sent to the student(s) about how the board has handled the complaint. If the complaint has had a concrete outcome in relation to the course etc., this must also be informed, unless it is a matter of personal issues, cf. above., The Board of Studies sends a copy of the answer to the Head of Department if this is deemed relevant.\n* The reply to a teaching/supervision complaint is not considered a decision in legal terms and, therefore, cannot be appealed.",
    "Exam rules": "All courses and projects contain one exam or multiple exams, called part exams. The exam may, for example, be a written exam (on campus), an oral exam, a written home assignment/report, or a practical exam. See examples of different exam forms at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Exam forms'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/exam-forms).\nThe exam's objective is to assess the extent to which the student meets the learning objectives defined for the course or project. The exam must reflect the overall course objectives, learning objectives, and content.\nStudents are entitled to three exam attempts in each course or project. Students can apply for an exemption for further examination attempts. Find more information at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exemption'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exemption).\nThe assessment form type, examination date, the learning objectives, etc., can be found in the course descriptions at [DTU Course Base.](http://kurser.dtu.dk/)\nRegistration and withdrawal from exam\n* [How to register and deregister for exams](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#How)\n* [Registration for the exam after the deadline](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Registration)\n* [When does a course become binding?](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#When)\n* [Registration for second and third exam attempt](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Registration)\n* [Overlap of exams in time](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Overlap)\n* [Exams in final projects, project courses, and internship](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Exam)\n* [Exam attempts](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Exam)\n* [Courses with part-exams](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Courses)\n* [Used up exam attempts](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Used)\n\n\nAll activities that form part of the programme must be assessed. To obtain an assessment, students must be registered for the exam in the activity. Students may not participate in an exam or have, for example, a substitution paper assessed if they are not registered for the exam in the course.\nStudents cannot register for exams in courses that have already been passed (grade 02 or higher or ‘Pass’).\n**_How to register and deregister for exams_** All course registrations are automatically transferred to exam registrations. The transfer takes place before the registration period for the exam begins. Students are responsible for all other exam registrations.\nThe student must ensure that _all_ exam registrations are correct, whether automatically transferred or not.\nThe student must be aware that registration and deregistration for the exam occur via [www.tilmelding.dtu.dk](http://www.tilmelding.dtu.dk). Course registration takes place via the Study Planner. Therefore, the student's check of whether the exam registrations are correct takes place at [www.tilmelding.dtu.dk](http://This therefore means that the student's check of whether the exam registrations are correct takes place at www.tilmelding.dtu.dk.). That is also where the student can unsubscribe and register for exams in courses other than those that have been transferred from the course registrations, e.g. a re-exam.\nStudents can find the deadlines for exam registrations, etc., at student.dtu.dk under [Exam/Registration and withdrawal from exam/Registration and withdrawal deadlines](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-registration/tilmeldingsfrister)\n** _Registration for the exam after the deadline_** Post-registration for the exam/re-exam can, as a rule, only take place for students who, due to special circumstances, have not been able to register for the exam during the ordinary registration period. Special conditions can be:\n* The student has been awaiting a decision from the Board of Exemptions regarding an additional examination attempt or a decision regarding exam cheating.\n* Own illness or illness/death in the immediate family.\n* Special permits from a course coordinator, e.g. in connection with exam prerequisites approved after the registration deadline.\n* If the registration results in the student being able to complete the education immediately after the exam period.\n\n\nAfter the exam registration deadline has expired, an electronic application form can be found at student.dtu.dk under ' [Exam/Registration and withdrawal from exam/Late exam registration'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-registration/late-exam-registration) The application must be accompanied by documentation regarding the special circumstances.\n_**When does a course become binding?**_ If the student does not withdraw from his/her first exam attempt in a course before the deadline for exam withdrawal, the course registration is binding, and the course becomes part of the student’s programme specification. Thus, the student must pass the course to complete the programme, cf. student.dtu.dk under ['Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Binding courses'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/binding-courses).\nA student may apply for cancellation of an exam registration in a course, but the application may only be met if the student does not plan to participate in the exam or, if the exam has been held, has not participated in the exam. Find more information on this type of exemption at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exemption](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exemption)'.\n**_Registration for the second and third exam attempt_** Students must register for and withdraw from any subsequent second or third exam attempt within the current deadlines. Find more information under 'Exam attempts' below. Similarly, students who have withdrawn from their first exam attempt in a course must register for a new exam in the course unless they register for the course once more.\n**_Overlap of exams in time_** If, after the publication of the dates for written exams, it transpires that a student has registered for two exams that overlap, the student is entitled to withdraw from one of the written exams and instead take the exam in question in the next (re-)exam period for the course. The same applies to oral exams if the student cannot arrange a different examination time for the oral exam with the examiner. The student must contact the Study Administration via student email at studadm@adm.dtu.dk  __before the exam is held.__\n**_Exam in final projects, project courses, and internship_** BEng projects, BSc projects, and MSc theses also conclude with an exam (an oral defence), but registration is made by the main supervisor for the final project via the project reporting system. The same applies to project courses and internships.\nSpecial rules apply for exam registration for guest students and students in part-time programmes. These rules are accessible on [DTU's webpage](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/continuing-education/open_university/admission_and_enrolment).\n**_Exam attempts_** Students are entitled to three exam attempts in each course or project.\nEven though several versions of the same course with different course numbers may be available, students only have three exam attempts. That also includes one or more exam attempts used under the vacant place scheme (vacant place on DTU’s courses offered to students as a part-time programme). Several versions of the same course both cover courses with different course numbers and/or titles and courses that are not applicable to other courses.\nIt counts as an exam attempt if a student does not participate in an exam and gets the grade EM (Not met). Read more at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Assessment forms and grading](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/assessment-forms-and-grading)'. The only exception is where the student can present documentation of illness. Read more about the rules at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Illness in connection with exams'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/illness-in-connection-with-exams)\nIt also counts as an exam attempt if the student does not meet any exam prerequisites, e.g. compulsory assignments, and the deadline for registering for the exam has been exceeded. The student will then receive the registration IG (Not approved). Read more at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Assessment forms and grading](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/assessment-forms-and-grading)'.\n**_Courses with part-exams_** Even if a student has passed one or more part-exams in a course, this does not count as an exam attempt if the student withdraws from the exam within the current deadlines. At the first (re)exam, already approved exam prerequisites or/and passed part-exams will remain valid. In addition, the general rules apply that:\n* the student can only participate in an offered re-exam without having participated in the previous ordinary exam in a course, provided that the student meets the prerequisites for participation in the ordinary exam and\n* in a course with part exams, the re-exam is merely a repetition of the final part exam in the course.\n\n\nIf the student wishes to register for the course again, exam prerequisites/part-exams may be re-taken. The re-exam rules can be found at student.dtu.dk under [‘Study rules'/'Exam'/'Re-exams’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/re-exams).\n_**Used up exam attempts**_ Students have three attempts to pass a course/project. If the student has used three attempts without passing, they will be expelled from the university unless they apply for an exemption and are granted an additional exam attempt. The student must apply for an exemption no later than one of the biannual regulation checks conducted by the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs. Rules on exemption can be found on student.dtu.dk under [Study rules'/'Exemption'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exemption)\nAssessment forms\nStudents must be assessed individually. In connection with individual exams, group exams, and group assignments, each student's performance must be assessed, and individual grades must be awarded. For group projects/exams, each student must be given their own grade or assessment; it is thus impossible to give a grade for the group as a whole.\nGrades and other assessments are confidential information that must not be communicated to anyone other than the student him-/herself unless the student has previously agreed to it. That also applies to group projects/exams unless otherwise agreed between the examiner and the students in the group.\nIn connection with their assessment, the external and primary examiner must take notes about the candidate’s performance and the grading for use in case of a future appeal. The notes must be kept for at least a year and until the conclusion of any subsequent appeal.\nThe assessment consists of a grade based on the 7-point grading scale or the assessment ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’. Find a description of the scale in ministerial order no. 1125 of 04/07/2022 on the Grading Scale of Study Programmes Offered under the Ministry of Higher Education and Science ([the Grading Scale Order - only in Danish)](http://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2022/1125).\nThe assessment ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’ can only be used for tests/exams accounting for up to one-third of the study programme’s ECTS credits. That does not apply to exams for which credits have been transferred from other universities. It is DTU's responsibility to comply with this requirement.\nAt least 1/3 of the total ECTS credits on the study programme must have been completed with external co-examination. That does not apply to exams for which credits have been transferred from other universities. It is DTU's responsibility to comply with this requirement.\nIn cases where an assessment cannot be made in accordance with the Danish 7-point grading scale or ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’, the following registration may occur in DTU's student system:\n* **SYG -** ‘Ill’ The registration is used if the student has been registered for the exam without participating - or has had to leave the exam due to illness without submitting an exam paper - and the student can present documentation of this. The documentation must be sent to the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs at studadm@adm.dtu.dk. Only the Office for Study Programmes and Students Affairs can make the registration *Ill'. See student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/Exam'/Illness in connection with exams](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/illness-in-connection-with-exams).\n* **EM** - ‘Not met' The registration is used if the student has been registered for the exam without taking the exam. It is registered that the student _has used_ an exam attempt.\n* **IG** - ‘Not approved’ The registration is used when the student fails to meet exam prerequisites. It is registered that the student _has used_ an exam attempt unless the student withdraws from the exam in the course. See student.dtu.dk under ‘[Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Mandatory participation in class and mandatory assignments](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/mandatory-participation-and-assignments)’.\n* **AB** - 'Awaiting decision Passed' The registration is used when the student has been reported for suspected exam cheating, and a decision has not yet been made. The registration is equated with a passed grade/assessment in the study administration system but without the actual assessment appearing. The student will see the registration 'AFV B' in their transcript. It is registered that the student _has used_ an exam attempt. Once a decision has been made in the cheating case, the registration will be changed to either 'SN' or the grade/assessment the student has received. Read more at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Cheating at exams and other forms of assessment](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/cheating-at-exams-and-other-forms-of-assessment)'.\n* **AI** - 'Awaiting decision Not passed' The registration is used when the student has been reported for suspected exam cheating, and a decision has not yet been made. The registration is equated with a failed grade/assessment in the study administration system but without the actual assessment appearing. The student will see the registration 'AFV IB' in their transcript. It is registered that the student _has used_ an exam attempt. Once a decision has been made in the cheating case, the registration will be changed to either 'SN' or the grade/assessment the student has received. Read more at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Cheating at exams and other forms of assessment](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/cheating-at-exams-and-other-forms-of-assessment)'.\n* **SN** - 'Cheating' (Snyd) The registration is used if the student has had an exam performance/result for an entire course cancelled because of a violation of the exam rules (exam cheating). It is registered that the student _has used_ an exam attempt.\n\n\nRequirements for passing exams and part-exams\n* [Part-exams assessed with part grades](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Part-exams)\n* [Part-exams based on an overall assessment](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Part-exams)\n\n\nA course has been passed if the student has been awarded the grade of 02 or higher or the assessment ‘Pass’. Part exams cannot be retaken if the course has been passed.\nAll part-exams on a course must be offered in the same course module unless otherwise stated in the course description. Find more information on part exams in connection with re-exams at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Re-exams'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/re-exams).\nRegardless of whether a student has completed one or more part-exams in a course, the student has the right to cancel the course and exam within the applicable deadlines and has thus not used an exam attempt in either the part-exams or the final exam.\nIn a course with part-exams, any re-exam is only a repetition of the final part-exam on the course. Part-exams scheduled in the teaching period will thus not be offered as a re-exam or will not be assessed in the period between the ordinary exam and the re-exam in the course. For more information, visit student.dtu.dk under ‘[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Re-exams’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/re-exams).\nA course with several part-exams can be assessed\n* either by using partial grades in the assessment of the part-exams\n* or based on an overall assessment of the different part-exams\n\n\nIt must be stated in the course description under 'Type of assessment' whether part-exams are assessed using partial grades or an overall assessment.\n_**Part-exams assessed with partial grades**_ If official partial grades are used for the individual part-exams in a course, the students are informed about the partial grades after each part-exam, and the total final grade is the weighted average of the partial grades, rounded to the nearest grade in accordance with the Danish 7-point grading scale. The final grade is rounded up if the average is halfway between two grades.\nHowever, a special pass requirement applies at DTU for courses with part exams for which partial grades are used. The pass requirement is: 1) that the average grade of the part-exams must be at least 02 without rounding up, and 2) that no partial grade must be below 00. For some courses, deviating from the above rule or establishing additional requirements for partial grades may be relevant. Such deviations must be approved by the Department Board of Studies and the Dean. The deviations must be stated in the course description.\nIf the student does not participate in a part-exam with a partial grade, the course cannot be passed, and the student must then be graded 'Not passed’, regardless of whether the course is graded according to the 7-step grading scale. This is to signal that no academic assessment has taken place. This also applies if other part-exams are passed.\nA student who has not participated in any of the part-exams and who has not deregistered for the exam must be registered with EM (Not met).\n_**Part-exams based on an overall assessment**_ When using overall assessment, no partial grades are given, and any indication of the weighting of the individual part exams is only indicative. Students may only be informed of and receive one final grade for the course.\nThe course coordinator can decide that one or more part exams must be completed/approved as a condition for receiving a grade or other assessment for the entire course based on an overall assessment. This means the part exam is mandatory and must be completed/approved to pass the course. In such a case, this must be stated in the course description. If it is not stated in the course description that one or more part exams must be completed/approved to pass the course, an overall assessment must be made of the remaining part exams the student has completed. The student can thus pass the course based on the remaining part exams. However, non-completed/approved part exams are included in the overall assessment.\nA student who does not participate in/hand in any of the part-exams in a course and who has not registered for the exam must be given the assessment 'Not met'.\nForms of examination\n* [Change of the form of examination due to special circumstances](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Change)\n* [Practical exams as part of the teaching or as a final test](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Practical)\n* [Oral exams](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Oral)\n* [Oral group exams](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Oral)\n* [Written assignments](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Submission)\n* [Group projects](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Group)\n* [Written exams (written on-site exams)](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Written)\n* [Exams conducted abroad](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Exams)\n* [Rescheduled exam for a cancelled written exam (on-site exam)](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Rescheduled)\n\n\nThe exam in a course may be written, practical, oral, or a combination thereof, for example, a series of part exams during the course.\nAfter the course descriptions are approved, the Department Board of Studies decides on the form of examination, including the type of part exams, to be used for the course.\nDifferent rules governing the primary forms of examination are described below. The relevant Department Board of Studies can approve other forms of examination.\n**_Change of the form of examination due to special circumstances_** Students may contact the Study Administration via student email to studadm@adm.dtu.dk to apply for a change in the form of examination in a course (e.g. from written to oral exam) based on special circumstances, for example, special conditions in relation to a documented permanent functional impairment. If the student informs to have a functional impairment, the Special Educational Support (SPS) team in the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs and Students will always be involved. The Study Administration will contact the course coordinator to assess whether, based on the course's learning objectives, it is academically sound and whether it is practically possible to change the examination form. If required, the SPS team (aus-sps@adm.dtu.dk) in the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs can assist in this assessment.\nA precondition for allowing a change of the examination form is that the exam's academic level is not lowered. Find more information at student.dtu.dk on '[Study rules'/Exam'/'Special Exam Arrangements'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/special-exam-arrangements)\n_**Practical exams as part of the teaching or as a final test**_ Courses comprising exercises (laboratory courses, workshop courses, etc.) may be subject to continuous assessment or include a practical exam at the end of the course. The students must be informed of the criteria for the assessment at the beginning of the course if the exams are subject to continuous assessment. Each student’s contribution must be clearly stated to be assessed individually.\n_**Oral exams**_ The student must bring his/her student card as identification to the oral exam.\nGenerally, all oral exams are open to the public but can be held behind closed doors under special circumstances justified, for instance, on the grounds of student needs. Projects which, entirely or partially, are carried out with private companies may, taking into account any information about trade secrets, know-how, etc., in the report, be treated as confidential and be held behind closed doors, too.\nOral exams may extend over several days. Any dates besides the specified exam dates must be agreed upon with the students. Students who are unable to attend an examination on these additional days are entitled to participate in the exam on the exam date in accordance with the timetable or on another day, subject to agreement with the lecturer.\nOral exams must be taken before the end of the exam period unless otherwise agreed between the course coordinator and the students.\nDue to legal rights, all oral exams must be conducted by two assessors. This also applies where the form of examination includes an oral element. The second assessor may be either an external examiner or a co-examiner/assessor from DTU.\n_Oral online exam_ Oral exams, including oral defence of the final project, cannot generally be held as online exams, and both assessors and students must participate in the exam with physical attendance. Online courses and courses offered as part of digital programmes (D.T.U.) are exempt from this rule.\nHowever, an oral examination can exceptionally be held as a  _partial_ online examination due to unusual circumstances. For example, due to an acute obstacle in the presence of one of the assessors, one assessor participates via an online connection. Individual online exams may also be relevant for guest students who need to take a re-exam after travelling back to their home university. The decision to conduct an oral online examination for individual students or assessors is made by the course coordinator/supervisor.\nThe Board of Studies must approve the decision to conduct an oral online examination for an  _entire_ course for all students based on completely extraordinary circumstances.\nGuides have been prepared for holding an online oral exam; one for students at student.dtu.dk under '['Exam'/'Exam guides'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-guides), and for lectures at DTU Inside under '[Educational administration'/'Guidance'/'Exam guides'](http://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/administration/vejledninger/digitaleksamenhelp).\n_**Oral group exams**_ An oral exam can take place as a group exam. Group exams are typically held in connection with written assignments prepared by two or more students (group projects).\nIn an oral group exam, each student must be examined in such a way as to ensure that an individual assessment of each student's performance is made and individual grades or other assessments are given; thus, one grade cannot be given to the group as a whole. It is important that each assessor notes the level and quality of participation of the individual students. The assessors must also ensure that all students participate in the exam to allow individual assessments to be made.\nWhen organizing an oral group exam, the course coordinator must ensure that the time allocated for the exam is adapted to the number of students participating in the exam. All members of the project group must be present during the entire exam.\nThe student must have his/her grade stated in private unless otherwise agreed between the examiner and the students in the group.\nIf an individual oral exam is held as a follow-up to a group project and as a follow-up to an oral group exam, if relevant, the other students in the group may not be present in the exam room before their own individual oral exam.\nThe possibility of choosing an individual exam instead of a group exam is only available to students with documented special educational needs. See above under ‘ _Change of form of examination due to special circumstances_. Special rules on oral group exams apply to final projects. Read more at student.dtu.dk under [‘Study rules'/'Rules for final projects’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/afsluttende-projekter) or in the study programme curriculum.\n_**Written assignments**_ Submission of assignments, reports, posters, etc., may be\n* an offer to students (the assignments are not part of the assessment)\n* an exam prerequisite that is a prerequisite for being able to take the exam in the course, for example, mandatory assignments. Exam prerequisites are not part of the assessment. See student.dtu.dk under ‘[Study rules'/Teaching'/'Mandatory participation in class and mandatory assignments'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/mandatory-participation-and-assignments), or\n* an element that is included as part of the assessment basis, e.g. a part-exam. A part exam can also be a mandatory element to pass the course. See student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Requirements for passing exams and part exams](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/requirements-for-passing-exams-and-part-exams)).\n\n\nWritten assignments can be prepared individually or as group assignments/projects. The course coordinator must inform the students if the project is expected to be individualized or not when prepared as a group project. If the project is not subjected to individualization, an oral examination must be held afterwards. This can either be conducted as a group exam or an individual exam. Find more information on group exams above under 'Oral group exams' and on group projects underneath.\nStudents can only expect to have take-home assignments corrected/assessed that have been submitted on time.\nAssignments must be prepared in the language of instruction. The students' exam papers must be prepared in the language of instruction. For assignments in Danish, students can also answer in Swedish and Norwegian. The assessors may allow exam papers to be submitted in other languages. Special rules apply to final projects. See students.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Final projects'.](http://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/regler/afsluttende-projekter)\n_**Group projects**_ The number of students on group projects should not exceed six people. If this aligns with the course's learning objectives, the course coordinator may decide on a lower or higher maximum number than six.\nSpecial rules apply to group size for BEng projects, BSc projects, and MSc theses. See student.dtu.dk under [‘Study rules'/'Rules for final projects](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/afsluttende-projekter)’.\nFor group projects/assignments, an independent grade or other assessment can only be awarded if the individual student’s contribution to the project can be ascertained (individualization). Thus, whether the project is individualized or not is of great importance to the exam form (see below).\nBefore the students commence a group project, the course coordinator must inform them whether they are required to individualize the project or not. If a group project does not comply with the requirements for individualization or other formal requirements, the paper may be rejected by the course responsible, and no assessment will be given.\nFor group projects, each student must have their own grade/other assessment; thus, one grade cannot be given to the group as a whole.\nIf the student has documented special educational needs, an individual exam instead of a group exam may be possible. See above under 'Change of assessment form due to special circumstances'.\n_Group projects _without_ individualization_ A group project for which the students’ individual contributions are not specified must, according to the Examination Order, _always_ be followed by _an oral exam_ , as it is not possible to make an individual assessment based on the group project alone. Only one grade will be given as an overall assessment based on the project and the subsequent oral exam. The oral exam can be either an individual exam (i.e. one student at a time) or an oral group exam; see the above.\n_Group projects _with_ individualization_ For group projects/group assignments where individualization is required, students’ individual contributions must be clearly distinguishable regarding the chapters and sections in the assignment. For larger group projects, it is accepted that general descriptive sections such as the introduction, problem statement, scope, conclusion, and the like are prepared jointly. Several students may well have the (main) responsibility for the same chapters/sections.\nIf the project states that the assignment overall has been prepared jointly, this will not fulfil the requirement for individualization.\nFor individualized group assignments/group projects, there is no requirement for a subsequent oral exam, and the assessment can be done based on the assignment/project alone.\n_**Written exams (written on-site exams)**_ Written exams are always individual. The duration of the exam must be stated in the course description. If less than ten students register for a written exam, the lecturer can change the assessment form to an oral exam until one week after the exam registration deadline. This must be done with due regard to the fact that the students were expecting a written exam. The lecturer is responsible for notifying the students in case of a change in the assessment form. Another approved assessment form can be applied if the lecturer and all registered students agree. If, based on a change in the form of examination announced after the cancellation deadline, the student wishes to be deregistered from the exam, this must be notified to the Study Administration via studadm@adm.dtu.dk no later than 14 days after notification from the course coordinator.\nRegarding which language the exam assignment must be in, please see the section '_Written assignments'_ above.\n_The actual exam-holding_ Students should arrive at a written exam 15 minutes before the exam begins to prepare themselves for the exam to start. Students who show up after the exam has started will not be allowed to participate in the exam. They will then receive an assessment of ‘Not met’ (‘Ej Mødt’).\nMusic players, ear protectors, electronic earplugs, or the like must not be brought to the exam. Ordinary earplugs are allowed. Using earplugs is at the student's risk; for example, announcements during exams can be difficult to hear.\nMobile phones and smartwatches should be turned off and placed face-up on the corner of the student's exam desk. The student must be aware that it can lead to suspicion of exam cheating if the phone/smartwatch is not turned off or is not lying on the corner of the table with the front facing up.\nFind information on aids for written exams at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Use of aids and materials at written exams](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/use-of-aids-and-materials-at-written-exams)'.\n_Digital exam_ Written on-site exams where all aids are allowed (and therefore also computers allowed) are, in principle, digital, i.e. the assignment is set and submitted digitally, and it is impossible to submit on paper. As a rule, there is no access to the internet. Access to the internet is only permitted if the lecturer has reported this via the exam reporting form to the exam office and, in writing, has informed the students of this before the exam. Find more information on aids and materials for written exams at student.dtu.dk under ['Study rules'/Exam'/'Use of aids and materials at written exams'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/use-of-aids-and-materials-at-written-exams).\nIt is a basic condition for grading an exam paper that the student has uploaded it correctly and in the correct format and that it is available to the lecturer in the exam platform (Digital Eksamen) that has been chosen for the particular exam.\nFind more information on written exams at student.dtu.dk under '[Exam/Exam guides'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-guides). Find information on special exam conditions for written exams at DTU at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/Special exam arrangements'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/special-exam-arrangements)\n_Written online home exam_ It is not permitted to hold a written exam as an online home exam. This was only temporarily allowed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n_**Exams conducted abroad**_ Exams may be conducted abroad with physical presence, provided the reason for doing so is that the student is unable to participate in the university's examinations in Denmark for practical or financial reasons. DTU approves the exam place and persons to organize the practical aspects of conducting the examination abroad.\nThe student is responsible for covering the expenses associated with examinations abroad.\nThe Ministerial Order on Payment for the Services of Civil Servants Serving Abroad (Bekendtgørelse om betaling for tjenestehandlinger i udenrigstjenesten) applies to conduct examinations at Danish representations abroad.\n_**Rescheduled exam for a cancelled written exam (on-site exam)**_ In each exam period, a permanent scheme has been established for extraordinary days to hold rescheduled exams. A rescheduled exam is only to be used as an absolute emergency procedure if, in exceptional cases, a written exam (on-site exam) for a course cannot be held as planned after all options for holding the exam as planned have been exhausted.\nA rescheduled exam is an offer to the students, which lapses if they decide not to take advantage of it. Students who do not take advantage of an offer of a rescheduled exam will not have used an exam attempt. Students can only participate in a new exam at the earliest the next time a (re)exam is offered.\nAt student.dtu.dk, under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Exam dates’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-dates), there is an overview of the scheduling of rescheduled exams.\nUse of aids and materials at written exams\nWhen formulating exam assignments, emphasis must be placed on testing the students’ academic knowledge at the time of the exam.\nAids and materials permitted at exams are specified in the course description. There are four options:\n1. No aids and materials permitted (except standard dictionaries and non-programmable calculators).\n2. Written materials permitted, i.e. books, notes, old take-home assignments, etc. but not technical aids, for instance, a laptop.\n3. All aids and materials permitted - without internet access, meaning that in addition to written aids, it is also permitted to bring a laptop, tablet, and similar devices. The use of generative AI is not allowed.\n4. All aids and materials permitted - with internet access. The use of generative AI is allowed.\n\n\nLaptops, tablets, calculators, and other electronic aids must not be set up in a way that enables communication with others inside or outside the exam room.\nStudents are always allowed to bring standard dictionaries, such as spelling dictionaries, contemporary language dictionaries, and other language dictionaries, but not, for example, technical or medical dictionaries. This does not include language exams where dictionaries are not permitted.\nStudents are always allowed to bring a calculator unless the department forbids using calculators or makes one available for the exam. The department can make computers available for the exam, in which case students are not allowed to bring their own computer.\nStudents may use earplugs during the exam but must apply for an exemption if they need additional noise-reducing aids, such as earmuffs. The application must be sent to specialexamconditions@adm.dtu.dk.\nStudents are not allowed to use their own printer for the exam, and it is not allowed to listen to music during an exam.\nRead about written exams (written on-site exams) at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Exam forms'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/exam-forms).\nA FAQ on written exams is available at student.dtu.dk under '[Exam/Exam guides](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-guides)'.\n**_Written exam, with all aids permitted, is conducted digitally_** For a written exam on campus with all aids allowed, you must bring a PC, as the exam task will be set digitally, and the exam answer must be submitted digitally. If the exam is not suitable for digital delivery, this will be announced by the course supervisor before the exam. In these cases, however, it is still mandatory to bring a PC, as the exam task will most often be set digitally.\nWhen submitting digitally, it is important to be able to insert drawings and formulas in the right places in the answer. There are a number of options for doing this: a small scanner, a digital pen/drawing board, or an independent camera or the PC's camera. It is not allowed to use mobile phones during the exam.\nA written digital exam can never be conducted as an online home exam, as this form of exam has been abolished. See student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules/Exam/Exam forms](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/exam-forms)'.\n_**Violation of the rules on the use of aids**_ Violating the rules of using aids and materials for written exams will lead to disciplinary measures towards students according to the rules regarding cheating at exams. Find more information on this at student.dtu.dk under [Study rules'/‘Exam’/'Cheating at exams and other forms of assessment'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/cheating-at-exams-and-other-forms-of-assessment)\nStudents must not gain unauthorized access to information during the exam, including online, when this is prohibited or by communicating with others. The exam paper submitted must be prepared during the exam by the student himself. If material prepared by others or jointly with others is used at the exam, reference must be made to this.\n** _Responsibility for own aids and devices_** Students are responsible for any aids and materials they bring to the exam, and DTU generally does not make facilities available for the use of aids. Students are not granted extra time for the exam if the aids they have brought to the exam have a malfunction, are out of power, etc.\n**_Special exam conditions for written exams_** It is possible to apply for special conditions for a written exam and obtain permission to use compensating aids (e.g. assistive aids for dyslexics) for written exams, where aids are otherwise not permitted.

For diploma students, however, the rules are laid down based on § 34 of the examination order for vocational higher education (BEK 863 of 14/06/2022).\nViolation of the exam rules will result in disciplinary sanctions against the student. See student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Disciplinary measures towards students'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/disciplinary-measures) Read more about the disciplinary sanctions used for violating the exam rules below under the section '_Sanctions'_.\nDTU has ratified the Danish code of conduct for research integrity and, based on this, has formulated DTU's own code of good scientific and ethical practice/conduct (DTU Code of Integrity in Research). This code, which includes everyone at DTU, implies that students, including PhD students, must demonstrate, via their projects and conduct during courses and participation in extracurricular activities and student competitions, that they have understood the principles of good scientific practice. Violation of the code will be dealt with according to DTU's rules on cheating at exams and other assessment forms. DTU’s principles for good scientific conduct can be found at DTU.dk under ['Research/Research framework/Principles for good scientific conduct'](http://www.dtu.dk/english/research/research-framework/principles_for_good_scientific_conduct)_._\nAt the beginning of their studies, students must actively express their acceptance of the code of honour to continue their studies at DTU. By signing, the student commits to demonstrating independence and integrity in their work and exams, and to not violating the rules on exam cheating. Acceptance of the Honour Code is a part of the commencement of studies exam for newly admitted BEng and BSc students. Admitted MSc students and international guest students must express their acceptance of the code in connection with registration for courses in the 1st semester. More information on DTU's code of honour can be found at student.dtu.dk under ['Exam/Exam cheating/DTU's code of honour'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/eksamenssnyd/dtu-code-of-honour).\n_**What is exam cheating?**_ DTU requires that students at DTU demonstrate independence in their work and that the exam always reflects their own independent performance. This is important as all assessments are individual, and the lecturer must be able to assess what the individual student has learned and can.\nThe rules below also include exam cheating in connection with exam prerequisites. Read more about these at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Mandatory participation in class and mandatory assignments'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/mandatory-participation-and-assignments) DTU considers it exam cheating, among other things, in the following cases:\n1. Plagiarism Plagiarizing means using someone else's text, results, ideas, images, figures, slides (also from teaching), notes, data, etc., as your own without indicating the precise source. Using AI, such as ChatGPT and similar forms of artificial intelligence, where it is not you but the program/robot that writes, solves a task, etc., is also plagiarism if you do not cite the source. Refining an assignment's content using grammar or spelling checks is widely accepted and does not require citation. It must be clear from an assignment answer, etc., which parts result from one's own thoughts and which are based on direct copying or processing of other people's knowledge, including from a program/robot. When using texts, images, graphs, etc., which are not your own, whether as a quote, paraphrase, report, translation, or assessment, a reference to the source must be made. A paraphrase is a reformulation of a text. Read more about plagiarism and correct citations and references at [www.stopplagiat.nu](http://www.stopplagiat.nu), a web tutorial for students about plagiarism. If you, in an individual assignment, use copies of notes, formula collections, assignment answers, etc., which have been prepared by others or in collaboration with others, this is also plagiarism unless you clearly refer to this and indicate the source. This is because the common notes, etc., are not your independent exam performance. You thereby conceal or mislead about your own efforts or results. Purchase of a completed assignment answer from an assignment bank, e.g. on the internet, is also plagiarism/exam cheating.\n2. Self-plagiarism This means reusing your own text that has previously been graded without quotation marks and source references. A written work can only form the basis for assessment once. A written work that has previously been graded at DTU or another educational institution cannot be included in a renewed assessment regardless of the grade obtained and even though it is the student's own previous written work.\n3. Academic dishonesty by, e.g. manipulating or falsifying data.\n4. Concealment or misleading of own efforts or results.\n5. Engages in unauthorized collaboration, e.g. in connection with an individual homework assignment, or gains unauthorized access to information during an individual exam via fellow students or others or digitally by receiving or attempting to receive assistance.\n6. Using unauthorized aids (read more at student.dtu.dk [here](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/use-of-aids-and-materials-at-written-exams)).\n7. Wrongfully acquisition of prior knowledge of the exam paper.\n8. Providing incorrect attendance information where attendance is required.\n9. Knowingly helps another student to violate the exam rules.\n10. Participation online in a written exam that takes place on campus (on-site test) where you sit somewhere other than in the exam room.\n\n\nOn student.dtu.dk, under ''[Exam/Exam cheating/Avoid exam cheating'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/eksamenssnyd/undgaa-eksamenssnyd) under 'Do's and don'ts', examples of everyday situations from the study where you can involuntarily come into conflict with the rules for exam cheating are described. Here is also a link to a web tutorial for students describing plagiarism and how to avoid plagiarism by knowing the basic rules for citation and source reference in written assignment answers.\n_**Notification of exam cheating**_ If there is a reasoned suspicion of violation of the exam rules, the lecturer must notify the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs via [eksamenssnyd.dtu.dk. ](http://eksamenssnyd.dtu.dk)\nReporting can occur during a teaching period, e.g. in connection with an exam prerequisite assignment or other written submission, or after the final exam.\nThe lecturer can find further guidance on reporting students for exam cheating and other things related to exam cheating at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules/Exam/Cheating at exams and other forms of assessment'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/cheating-at-exams-and-other-forms-of-assessment)\n_**What should a notification report contain?**_ A notifying report should contain the following information:\n_Background specification:_ A brief description covering how the student's behaviour during the exam or assignment differs from the expected and gives rise to suspicion of cheating. The background specification should clearly mark what is not considered to reflect the student’s independent performance. Within the context of plagiarism, it should be stated how the student could have quoted correctly.\n_Flag exam cheating_ _:_ In the student’s exam paper or an independent document developed by the lecturer, the plagiarised parts of the assignment should be marked clearly: Text, graphs, equations, document creation, etc. The plagiarised parts should be marked clearly, e.g. by yellow highlighting. When the system identifies plagiarism, the report from the antiplagiarism software program should always be enclosed, together with the original text plagiarized from, if possible.\n_Evaluation form:_ What type of evaluation does the course have, and how much does the part that contains supposed plagiarism/exam cheating weigh?\nThe lecturer must be aware that the report is transmitted in original form to the student(s) in question in connection with the student(s) 's hearing.\n_**How must the lecturer assess the student who is reported?**_ When the lecturer reports grades or Passed/Failed for the entire course, this must also be done for the student(s) the lecturer has reported or will report for the presumption of exam cheating.\nThe lecturer must make their assessment of the reported student(s) without including the suspicion of exam cheating. Depending on whether the student has passed or not passed the course as a whole, the lecturer in the Grade Reporting System must enter the following for the affected students:\nAI = Awaiting decision Failed, or AB= Awaiting decision Passed\nIn the study administration system, AB appears as passed, and AI appears as failed. You can find more information on these registrations at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Assessment forms and grading](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/assessment-forms-and-grading)'.\nThe lecturer must then inform the student(s) that they will be or have been reported for suspicion of exam cheating. Read below under '_Information to the reported student(s) from the lecturer'._\nAfter a decision has been made, the registration AB or AI will be changed to SN (Cheating) if the student is found guilty of exam cheating.\nIf the student is not found guilty of exam cheating, or the student only receives a reprimand or warning, the Office for Student Programmes and Student Affairs will write in the decision and ask the lecturer to release the grade/assessment for the student(s). The lecturer does this by emailing the assessment to studadm@adm.dtu.dk after which AB or AI will be changed to the assessment given.\n_**Information to the reported student(s) from the lecturer**_ In connection with reporting a student, the lecturer must inform the student that they have been reported. It just needs to be an informational email; the student will, in connection with the hearing conducted by the Office for Student Programmes and Student Affairs, get access to all material in the case. At student.dtu.dk, under '[Educational administration'/'Guidance'/'Exam cheating'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/eksamenssnyd), the lecturer can find a template for an information e-mail.\n_**What is the student's position during the cheating case?**_ As long as a case concerning exam cheating is being processed, the reported student has the right to participate in teaching and exams in the course. However, there may be exceptions depending on the extent of the alleged exam cheating, e.g. exam cheating in connection with the final project.\nIf the student plans to participate in the re-exam in the course in which he or she has been reported, and a decision has not yet been made regarding the cheating case, the following applies:\n* If a decision is made that the student has _not cheated_ , the result of any re-exam will be cancelled, and the initial assessment from the first exam will be valid. However, this does not apply if the student did not pass the course/project at the initial assessment but has passed the course/project at a subsequent re-exam. In this case, the passed result from the re-exam will be valid.\n* If a decision is made that the student _has cheated_ , the result of this exam will be cancelled, an exam attempt has been used and the exam result from the re-exam will take its place.\n* If the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs decides in the case before the re-exam of the course but after the registration and deregistration deadline for the exam, the student must contact the Office if they wish to be re-registered or deregistered for the exam. Read more at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Registration and withdrawal](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/registration-and-withdrawal)'.\n\n\n_**Sanctions**_ After hearing of the reported student(s), the Office decides on the case according to DTU's rules on cheating in exams and other assessments (these rules) and DTU's disciplinary rules towards students.\nDTU has the following reactions and sanction options for violation of examination rules, cf. DTU's disciplinary measures towards students:\n1. Written reprimand\n2. Written warning against repeated violation of the rules\n3. Expulsion from the exam, i.e. non-assessment or cancellation of the exam performance. This sanction implies that an exam attempt has been used and that the student must register for a re-exam.\n4. Expulsion from the university for a limited period or permanently. Temporary expulsion can be months, a semester, or several semesters. In the event of temporary expulsion during a project period for a final project, the project period will be cancelled, an exam attempt will be used, and the student must start a new project period after the expulsion period.\n\n\nIf the presumption of exam cheating is confirmed, the sanction in cases of a milder nature will most often be a written warning in combination with a cancellation of the exam result. In more serious cases of exam cheating or cases of repeated violation of the rules on exam cheating, the student will also be expelled temporarily or permanently.\nFor a further description of the above forms of sanction, please refer to [DTU's disciplinary measures against students](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/disciplinary-measures).\nThe case processing time for exam fraud varies and is, at the moment, approximately 3-4 months. The month of July is not included in the calculation.\n_**Complaint guidance**_ The student can appeal the decision to The Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science if the appeal concerns legal issues. Legal issues can be e.g. non-compliance with the educational rules that apply to the education and whether other legislation (e.g. the Public Administration Act) and the general principles of administrative law have been complied with. The Agency thus does not deal with academic issues, as the universities have academic self-governance. The deadline for submission of an appeal is two weeks from the day the decision is announced to the student. The appeal should be submitted to DTU, the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs via [eksamenssnyd.dtu.dk.](http://eksamenssnyd.dtu.dk/)\nWhen DTU receives an appeal about a decision, a reassessment of the decision is made based on the information the student has provided in the appeal. In this connection, DTU may decide to reopen the case if the appeal contains information of significant importance to the case or if significant case-handling errors have occurred in the original processing of the case.\nIf DTU chooses to maintain the original decision, DTU will prepare a statement about the decision and the appeal. The statement will be sent to the student, who can comment on it. Finally, the entire case will be sent to the Agency for their consideration. The processing time at the Agency is currently approx. six months from the time DTU sends the appeal to the agency.\nAn appeal to the Agency usually does not have a suspensive effect on the sanction the student has received. Cancellation of the exam and a possible expulsion will, therefore, continue to apply.\n_**The lecturer can give oral reprimands for minor offences**_ If the lecturer assesses that the student's violation of the rules for the exam must be considered a minor offence and below the trifling limit (e.g. failure to comply with the rules for correct reference to sources in a part exam that is included with very little weight (approx. 5%) in the overall assessment of the course), the lecturer has the option of giving the student an oral reprimand instead of making a report to the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs. The lecturer can always contact the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs to discuss the matter.\nThe reprimand is not to be considered as a sanction but as a pedagogical recommendation to comply with the rules and with information on how the student has violated the rules of the exam and how the student can avoid cheating in the future. The reprimand is primarily intended for newer students who need clarification of how to quote/refer correctly, collaborate with other students without violating the exam rules, or use common notes in an individual, written answer.\nThe part exam/part assignment that is the subject of the violation of the rules for the exam, or parts thereof, must be excluded from the assessment basis.\nThe Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs must not be notified that an oral reprimand has been given unless the lecturer notices that the student continues to violate the examination rules. In these cases, a report must be made (see above), and the lecturer should refer to the fact that a charge was previously given.\nRead about the sanction reprimand at students.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Disciplinary measures towards students'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/disciplinary-measures)\nSpecial examination conditions\n* [Special examination conditions granted by AUS](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#SPECIAL)\n* [Special conditions for written exams](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Special)\n* [Special conditions for final projects](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Special)\n* [Special examination conditions granted by the department](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#SPECIAL)\n* [Special conditions for an oral exam](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Special)\n* [Special conditions for projects in courses](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Special)\n* [Exams at universities other than DTU](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#EXAMS)\n\n\n** _Special examination conditions granted by AUS_**\n_**Special conditions for written exams**_ The Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs (AUS) may allow special examination conditions based on the following circumstances:\n1. Students with physical or mental impairment (e.g. physical disability, dyslexia, etc.). The impairment must significantly impact the student’s potential exam performance.\n2. Students whose native language and qualifying exam are not Danish may - provided that the exam is only in Danish - be granted extra time for a written exam during their first two semesters in Denmark. In this context, a Greenlandic or Faroese qualifying exam can be equated with a foreign qualifying exam.\n3. Students with similar difficulties, for instance, students who are in the last month of pregnancy or who are breastfeeding an infant.\n\n\nIt must be possible to document the circumstances on which the grant of special conditions is based. For more information about valid documentation, please visit student.dtu.dk under ['Apply for/Special examination conditions](http://student.dtu.dk/en/apply-for/saerlige-vilkaar-eksamen)'. Exam anxiety, for example, is not a valid reason for special exam conditions.\nThe granting of special conditions presupposes that AUS assesses that equating the student with others in the same examination situation is necessary. It is a prerequisite that the grant of special conditions does not lower the academic level of the exam.\nDepending on the student's application, situation, diagnosis, documentation, etc., AUS may grant the student special exam conditions that apply to anything between a semester and the remainder of the study period. The decision to the application will state how long the student has been granted special exam conditions, and the next deadline for a new application will be stated if the student should apply again.\nThe following special conditions may be granted for written exams.\n* Extra time: Usually, 25% extra time is granted.\n* Use of own computer, possibly with support programs: Also for exams where aids are otherwise not allowed. A solemn declaration must be signed. Typically applied for by dyslexic, visually impaired as well as physically challenged students.\n* Special physical setting: This is typically if the student is physically challenged and needs a height-adjustable table, or if the student is very sensitive to sound or suffers from social anxiety.\n* Other: For example, noise-cancelling headphones, a table lamp with a special light, etc. Diabetics can also get permission to use their mobile phones for diabetes monitoring. A declaration of faith and law must be signed.\n\n\nThe decision to grant students special conditions for written exams is valid for the following written exams and is granted based on the following practice:\n* A written exam held during the [ordinary exam period](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-dates). The student usually receives extra time through an automatic assignment.\n* A minor written exam held on campus (on-site exams), that is either an exam prerequisite or that is included with a minimum of 20% in the final assessment. The exam is typically held during the teaching period and handled by the department, not AUS. The student must inform the lecturer that he/she has been granted special conditions for a written exam by AUS. The student must contact the lecturer by mail as quickly as possible and attach the decision to the application as documentation of the special conditions the student has been granted. The lecturer may contact the SPS unit via specialexamconditions@adm.dtu.dk in case of questions.\n\n\n_Application deadlines and submission of the application_\nApplications received:\n* 1 November - will be processed before the month of December\n* 15 April - will be processed before the month of May\n* 1 July - will be processed before the month of August\n\n\nApplications are processed continuously, so please send your application as soon as possible.\nSpecial conditions for written exams will often be granted for several semesters or the rest of the study period. The time period is stated in the decision letter.\nThe student must send applications for special conditions at written exams from the student's email to specialexamconditions@adm.dtu.dk. The application form can be found at student.dtu.dk under '[Apply for/Special examination conditions](http://student.dtu.dk/en/apply-for/saerlige-vilkaar-eksamen)'. Here, you can also read more about filling out the application form. In the case of emergencies (e.g. a broken arm), students can apply after the deadline by writing to studadm@adm.dtu.dk.\nThe application is processed in AUS. The caseworkers are subject to a duty of confidentiality, and personal information, as well as the outcome of the application, will, therefore, be treated as confidential. AUS makes a decision based on the application and the enclosed documentation. The decision to the application is sent to the applicant's student email 3-4 weeks after the application deadline. The letter is exclusively digital and must be presented via mobile phone or computer to the examination guards when attending the exam. Students who hold the previous laminated cards as proof can continue to use them. Both the digital letter and the laminated cards are valid.\n_Exam paper handed out on USB key for written exam_ Students who have been allowed to use their own computers can order a non-digital exam assignment to be handed out on a USB key. The relevant application form can be found at [student.dtu.dk](http://Apply for Special examination conditions). If the student wishes to hand in the exam answer on a USB key, the student must inform the lecturer beforehand.\nThe deadlines for having the exam assignment handed out on a USB key are as follow:\n* Ordinary winter exam after the autumn 13-week period:  _1 November_\n* Exam after the 3-week period in January:  _the last day of the supplementary registration period_\n* Ordinary summer exam after the spring 13-week period:  _15 April_\n* Exam after the 3-week period in June:  _the last day of the supplementary registration period_\n* Exam after the 3-week period in July:  _the last day of the supplementary registration period_\n* Reexam and exam after the 3-week period in August:  _the last day of the supplementary registration period_\n\n\n_**Special conditions for final projects**_ If the period for which the student has been granted special conditions for written exams also includes the period for a final written project (BEng project, BSc project, or MSc thesis), the student may receive up to three weeks extra time to prepare the project before the start of the project. It is up to the student to decide whether he or she wants one, two, or three weeks. Should the student prepare his/her project in collaboration with students who have not been granted extra time, the entire project group will be granted extra time. The decision to the application must be presented as documentation to the project supervisor. The supervisor must register the extension of the project period in the Project Registration System (Projektindberetningssystemet) before the project's start date. For any questions, the SPS Unit can be contacted at specialexamconditions@adm.dtu.dk The student must be aware that DTU's rules and the rules of SU (state educational grant and loan scheme) do not coincide on this point.\nIf the student wishes to apply for an extension of the project period during the project due to unforeseen circumstances, please refer to the possibilities for applying for an extension of the submission deadline via the relevant department board of studies or the exemption board. Find more information at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Final projects'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/afsluttende-projekter)\n_**Special examination conditions granted by the department**_\nThe following is a description of the special arrangements that a lecturer may provide in other exam situations. In these cases, it is not a question of the student being entitled to special arrangements, but the examiner/lecturer must consider the student's special challenge, if relevant and possible. The SPS Unit can assist the lecturer with guidance, if desired, via specialexamconditions@adm.dtu.dk\nThe granting of special conditions presupposes that the department/the lecturer assesses that it is necessary to equate the student with others in the same examination situation. It is a prerequisite that the grant of special conditions does not lower the academic level of the exam.\nIf the student wishes to request special conditions, he/she must contact the course coordinator/examiner as quickly as possible and provide documentation of the request's basis. However, if the cause is speech challenges with the student, the circumstance is assumed to be assessable to the lecturer during a regular conversation.\n**_Special conditions for an oral exam_** If the student has been granted special conditions for a written exam, these special conditions also apply to an oral exam, provided the student has a need for them. Typically, 25% extra time is granted for written exams, but the amount of extra time required for oral exams may vary. The necessary time is generally agreed upon between the student and the course coordinator. The student must contact the course coordinator no later than one month before the oral exam. The SPS Unit (specialexamconditions@adm.dtu.dk) can assist the course coordinator in this assessment. Read more at student.dtu.dk under ‘[Apply for/Special examination conditions](http://student.dtu.dk/en/apply-for/saerlige-vilkaar-eksamen)'. If the student is to take part in an oral group exam but is part of a group where the other students have not been granted extra time, the lecturer/examiner may assign the whole group extra time. The allocated extra time only applies to the individual exam and is assessed individually each time. Thus, the assessment does not set a precedent for oral exams in other courses.\n**_Special conditions for projects in courses_** For longer-term projects/assignments in courses or the internship report for BEng students, the student can request the course coordinator to extend the project period. It is the lecturer's decision based on a practical assessment, including, e.g. with regard to the assessment of and feedback to the other students on the course, and assessment of the risk of exam cheating, whether it is possible to allocate extra time. In the latter case, the type of project/task will be of significant importance. If the student is part of a group and can apply for extra time for his/her project work while the other group members cannot apply for extra time, the lecturer/course coordinator can grant extra time to the whole group.\n_**Exams at universities other than DTU**_\nGrants of special exam conditions are only valid at DTU. If a student takes courses at other universities, the student must familiarize himself/herself with the university's rules and procedures for applying for special exam conditions. This also applies to students enrolled in a joint programme in Denmark or abroad or if the student is studying abroad or is going to study abroad.\nlllness in connection with exams\n* [Illness before the exam (unable to participate in the exam)](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Illness)\n* [Illness during the exam](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Illnes)\n* [Illness of a close family member](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Illness)\n* [Illness during the project period under the final project](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Illness)\n\n\n_**Illness before the exam (unable to participate in the exam)**_ Students who cannot participate in an exam due to illness must send documentation of the illness through their student mail to the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs at studadm@adm.dtu.dk no later than two weeks following the exam date. The student will get the registration 'Ill' (SYG). The registration 'Ill' does not count as an exam attempt. The student must bear the expenses for the medical certificate.\n**_Illness during the exam_** Students who become ill during the exam must notify an invigilator or examiner before leaving the exam. Students must contact the doctor on the exam day or the proximate weekday at the latest. The process hereafter is described above under '_Illness before the exam'_.\nIf the student, despite illness, chooses to complete an exam, i.e. submits their exam answer, it counts as an exam attempt, and the attempt cannot be cancelled.\nThe students must register for a new exam in the same course in a later examination term.\n_**Illness of a close family member**_ If a student is unable to participate in an exam due to a severe illness of a family member or friend, or in case of a serious event that may affect the student’s performance at the exam, the student can apply to have the exam registration (the exam attempt) changed to the registration 'Ill' by submitting relevant documentation to the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs via the Study Administration's [contact form](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/faglig/vejledningstilbud/studieadministration/kontakt-studieadministrationen) or if you are an external party by writing to studadm@adm.dtu.dk This must be done no later than two weeks after the exam date. If the student has already completed the exam, it will count as an exam attempt, and the exam cannot be cancelled.\n_**Illness during the project period under the final project**_ If a student falls ill while completing the final project, the student's programme specification rules apply. Find the rules at student.dtu.dk under ‘[Study rules’/‘Final projects](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/afsluttende-projekter)’.\nExternal examiners and confidentiality\nThe course description specifies whether a course is assessed by an external examiner or as an internal examination. An external examiner always assesses final projects.\nAll external examiners used at DTU must be members of the nationwide engineering examiner corps ([www.censornet.dk](http://www.censornet.dk/)).\nThe Public Administration Act covers the external examiners' activities, including the provisions on disqualification and secrecy.\nLecturers can find much relevant information on using external examiners at DTU Inside under '[Educational administration'/'Procedures'/'External examination'](http://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/administration/procedurer/censur).\nProjects which, entirely or partially, are carried out with private companies may, taking into account any information about trade secrets, know-how, etc., be treated as confidential, which means that the oral presentation will not be open to the public. Find more information on oral exams at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/Exam forms](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/exam-forms)'. It may be agreed upon that the report must not be publicly available.\nDeadlines for grading\n_Exams in 13-week courses and project courses_ No later than 20 workdays after the day of the exam.\n_3-week courses_ No later than 20 workdays after the last day of the 3-week period.\n_Engineering internship_ No later than 20 workdays after the submission date of the report.\n_BEng project/BSc project/MSc thesis_ The grade is awarded in connection with the oral exam/defence. The oral exam must be held no later than ten workdays after the scheduled submission date of the written report. In exceptional circumstances, the head of the department can approve a later exam date for the oral exam. If the project period has been extended after the start of the project as a result of the Board of Studies’ or the exemption committee's decision, the 10-day deadline must, as far as possible, continue to be complied with. A later exam date due to the changed conditions, e.g. due to the supervisor's 3-week holiday in June, July, or August, can be determined without approval from the head of the department.\nIt appears from the programme specification for final projects that in determining the start date of the project, the supervisor's 3-week consecutive summer vacation in June, July, or August must be taken into account in order not to come into conflict with the 10-day deadline of the oral defence, cf. below under ‘Assessment’. The project plan should also reflect this matter.\nRe-exams\n* [Courses with exam prerequisites](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Courses)\n* [Courses with part exams](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Courses)\n* [Special circumstances regarding exams in courses that will finish the entire study programme ](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Special)\n\n\nStudents may participate in an offered re-exam without having participated in the previous ordinary exam on a course if they meet the requirements for participation in the ordinary exam. See below under ‘ _Courses with exam prerequisites’._\nIn courses with part exams, students must be aware that a re-exam is solely a repetition of the final part exam on the course. See below under ‘Courses with part exams’.\nStudents who have not passed a course at the first exam attempt must register for the subsequent exam attempt in the course via [www.tilmelding.dtu.dk](http://www.tilmelding.dtu.dk), unless the student chooses to follow the teaching again. In this case, course registration must take place via the Study Planner.\nAll courses are offered for re-exam. The time of the re-exam will depend on when the course in question is offered:\n* For courses offered in the _13-week autumn period_ with ordinary exams in December, the re-exam period is in May\n* For courses offered in the _13-week spring period_ with ordinary exams in May, the re-exam period is in August\n* For courses offered in the _3-week period in January_ with ordinary exams in January, the re-exam period is in May\n* For courses offered in the _3-week periods June/July_ with ordinary exams in June/July, the re-exam period is in August\n* For courses offered in the _3-week period in August_ with ordinary exams in August, the re-exam period is in December.\n\n\nCourses offered in several of the above teaching periods have corresponding re-exam periods.\nIf a course is no longer provided, two additional re-exams will be offered in the course. The location of the re-exam dates will follow the rules mentioned above.\nIf in exceptional cases, a course is not suitable for a re-exam based on a security or academic assessment, students who have not passed the course must attend the course again. It is not sufficient only to register for the course exam. The relevant Department Board of Studies must approve that the course is not suitable for being offered for a re-exam, and it must also be stated in the course description under ‘Type of assessment.\nAn overview of exam dates can be found at student.dtu.dk under ['Exam'/'Dates of exams'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-dates).\nRegistration for and withdrawal from re-exams must be made within the applicable deadlines. See student.dtu.dk under [‘Exam/Registration and withdrawal from exam/Registration and withdrawal deadlines’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/eksamen/exam-registration/tilmeldingsfrister).\nIn consultation with the department's Board of Studies, the course manager can decide that there should be no external examiner at a re-exam. However, this requires that it is only a matter of re-exam for very few students and/or that the exam takes place outside the exam period with only very few examinees.\nFor rules on re-exams on project courses, see [‘Study rules'/'Teaching'/Project courses’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/project-courses).\n_Changed form of examination_ The course manager may decide that the examination form at the re-exam may differ from that at the ordinary exam.\nThe course manager must communicate the form of examination for re-exams in December and May to the students no later than one week after the registration deadline for the exam period in question has expired. The students then have 14 days to unregister from the re-exam if they do not wish to participate.\nThe course manager must communicate the form of examination for the re-exam in August to the students no later than one week after the end of the exam registration deadline. If, based on a change in the form of examination announced after the cancellation deadline, the student wishes to be deregistered from the exam, this must be notified to the Study Administration via studadm@adm.dtu.dk no later than 14 days after notification from the course coordinator.\n_**Courses with exam prerequisites**_ A student who has not fulfilled the exam prerequisites in a course in connection with the ordinary exam cannot participate in the re-exam unless the course manager has given the student a new opportunity to meet the prerequisites before the re-exam. The student is responsible for contacting the course manager to clarify this matter before registering for the exam. Students who, due to a decision from the course manager, cannot meet the exam prerequisites will have to attend the course again.\nStudents who met the exam prerequisites but did not pass the exam can take the re-exam on the course in the next re-exam period without having to fulfil the exam prerequisites again.\nIf a student chooses to postpone their re-exam - or if they do not pass their re-exam in accordance with the above - they are not entitled to be allowed to take (another) re-exam based on previously approved exam prerequisites. Thus, the student must fulfil the prerequisites again. That also applies if the student does not attend the exam due to a documented illness. Based on an academic assessment, the course manager may, however, approve that the student can register for a re-exam again without having to fulfil the prerequisites again.\nRead more at student.dtu.dk under [‘Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Mandatory participation and assignments’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/mandatory-participation-and-assignments).\n_**Courses with part exams**_ In a course with part exams, any re-exam is only a repetition of the final part exam. Part exams scheduled in the teaching period will thus not be offered as a re-exam or be assessed in the period between the ordinary exam and re-exam on the course. The course manager may deviate from this.\nGenerally, approved part exams will only be included in the next re-exam period. In connection with a re-exam, students are thus not entitled to retake an approved part exam. However, under special circumstances, students may have to retake a passed part exam in connection with a re-exam. The course manager makes such a decision based on an academic assessment. In the case of disagreement between a student and a course manager regarding whether or not a part exam must be retaken in connection with a re-exam, the Department Board of Studies will decide.\nThe course manager may approve that passed/approved part exams be included in subsequent (re)exams; this must be upon a student's request.\nSome courses may have general rules for whether part exams will be included in the course's next (re)-exam. Please check the course description.\nRead more about part exams at student.dtu.dk under [‘](http://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/regler/regler-for-eksamen/bedoemmelsesformer-og-karaktergivning)[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Requirements for passing exams and part exams](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/requirements-for-passing-exams-and-part-exams).\n_**Special circumstances regarding exams in courses that will finish the entire study programme** _ If a student has been ill at the (re)exam during the exam period, in which the student should have completed his/her education, the student has the right to sit the re-exam in the same exam period or immediately after the re-exam period. This also applies to a student who does not pass (-3 or 00, or not passed) an exam or re-exam in a single course in the exam period in which the student should have completed his / her education. Students who have been absent from the exam (non-attendance) or received the registration 'SN' (Cheating) are not entitled to a quick re-exam.\nThe above rules also apply to students who must hand in their final project immediately after the exam term in which they have not passed their last course.\nStudents wishing to take a quick re-exam according to the above rules should contact the Study Administration via student email to studadm@adm.dtu.dk no later than 14 days after the grade is published. If the student meets the requirements for a quick (re)exam, the Study Administration will inform the student. In consultation with the student, the lecturer determines the time and date of the (re)exam.\nThe rules above do not apply in connection with final projects.\nExam complaints\n* [Deadline for complaints](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Deadline)\n* [Filing a complaint](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Filing)\n* [What is the position of the student during the complaint process](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#What)\n* [Processing of the complaint](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Assessment)\n* [The decision](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#The)\n* [Appeal of decision](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Appeal)\n* [Errors and deficiencies in exams](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Errors)\n\n\n_**Deadline for complaints**_ If a student wishes to complain about how the exam has progressed or the assessment itself, they can file an exam complaint. Exam complaints must be submitted within two weeks of the announcement of the grade on student.dtu.dk. The deadline for oral examinations is two weeks after the examination is held. However, the days from 24 December to 1 January are not included in the calculation of the complaint deadline.\n_Prior dialogue with the assessor_ It is recommended that the student discusses his/her exam answer/performance with the assessor before the student submits an exam complaint. The student must be aware that contact or attempts to contact the lecturer do not have a suspensive effect on the appeal deadline, i.e. it does not extend the two-week time limit for appeal, which must, therefore, continue to be complied with. In the complaint, the student can e.g. state that he/she will send a detailed complaint or withdraw the complaint after he/she has had the opportunity to talk with the assessor.\nA conversation with the assessor about the exam answer/performance will not affect the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs' assessment of the complaint. The sole purpose is for the student to gain an understanding of and an explanation of the assessment given, which may lead to the student no longer wishing to complain or wishing to withdraw an already submitted complaint or that the student can write a better justification for his/her complaint.\nA possible conversation with the assessor about an exam answer/performance cannot lead to a changed assessment unless an error in the assessment is discovered.\n_**Filing a complaint**_ An exam complaint must be submitted via the Exam Complaint System [eksamensklager.dtu.dk](http://www.eksamensklager.dtu.dk). When the complaint has been submitted in the Exam Complaint System, the student receives a receipt and information email via his/her student email.\nComplaints about part exams can only be submitted as part of a complaint about the final grade or other assessment in the course.\nA complaint can be submitted on your own behalf, but it is also possible to add co-complainants if several people want to complain together, e.g. about the assessment of a group project. Co-complainants receive a copy of emails sent to the person who sent the complaint and only have viewing access to the system. It is important to ensure that consent is obtained from any co-complainants before they are added to the complaint in the system.\nComplaints can be submitted regarding the following:\n1. Legal issues (e.g. non-compliance with rules and legislation)\n2. The basis for examination (questions, assignments, etc.)\n3. The exam process\n4. The assessment\n\n\nThe complaint must state what is being complained about and what is desired to be achieved with the complaint. As the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs makes a decision based on the complaint, the assessor's opinion, and any supplementary comments of the student, the student should, in the reason for the complaint, compare his/her exam performance with the course's learning objectives, elaborate the course of the exam or the like. Complaints without justification will be sent back to the student requesting further information. If the student does not elaborate on his/her complaint, the complaint will be processed on the basis available.\nThe complaint must be able to be sent to the assessor as it appears. In its decision, the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs cannot include information that the student does not wish to pass on to the assessor. Complaints about teaching/teacher/supervisor must be submitted to the board of studies at the department where the course is offered or where the lecturer is employed. Read more on student.dtu.dk under ['Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Complaints about teaching and supervision'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/complaints-regarding-teaching-and-supervision)\nIf the complaint does not concern dissatisfaction with the exam but rather offensive or abusive behaviour, and the student wants help and guidance to handle this or wants to report the teacher/supervisor or others for offensive behaviour, he or she must not send an exam complaint as described above. Instead, please refer to [these guidelines](http://student.dtu.dk/en/vejledning/kraenkende-adfaerd) for offensive behaviour.\nThe total case processing time for exam complaints is approximately 3-4 months from the time the complaint is received until a decision has been made. The student may continue on the programme according to the applicable rules while the complaint is processed.\nComplaints about exams in courses at DTU Admission Course must be submitted to DTU Admissions Course. Contact information can be found on DTU's website [here](http://www.adgangskursus.dtu.dk/english).\n_**What is the position of the student during the complaint process**_ If the student plans to participate in the re-exam in the course to which the student's examination complaint relates, and a decision has not yet been made regarding the complaint, the following applies:\n* If the student is offered a new assessment (re-assessment) or new exam (re-exam) and accepts this offer, the result of any re-exam will be cancelled, and it will be the result of the new assessment/re-exam that applies. The new assessment/exam does not count as an exam attempt.\n* If the student's complaint is not upheld, the result of a possible re-exam will still be valid, and an exam attempt has been used.\n\n\nIf the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs manages to make a decision on the matter before the re-exam is held, but after the registration and de-registration deadline for the exam has expired, the student must contact the Study Administration if he/she wishes to be registered or de-registered for the re-exam. Read more on student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Registration and withdrawal](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/registration-and-withdrawal)'.\n_**Processing of the complaint**_ The assessor(s) access the student's complaint in the Exam Complaint System.\nThe assessor(s) he assessor(s), including a possible external examiner, must make an academic opinion based on the complaint. The statement must contain an explanation of the assessment and respond to all of the student's academic complaints. When the assessors have submitted their opinion, the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs will make the opinion available to the student in the Exam Complaint System. The student then has the opportunity to make any further comments before a decision is made. This is called a hearing. The student has two weeks to comment on the statement from the assessor(s).\nThe Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs may choose to hear the assessor(s) again if the student's comments give rise to it, just as the assessors' further comments can be sent in hearing to the student if the assessor's comments contain new information of material importance to the decision of the case.\nWhen the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs believes that the case has been adequately clarified, a decision is made based on the complaint, the assessors' statement(s), and the student's possible comments, if any.\nA decision on the matter is made by the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs based on the assessors’ statement and the student’s comments, if any. The student receives an email via his/her student email when a decision has been made.\nIf an exam complaint does not deal with academic issues but only legal or technical issues, e.g. regarding the conduct of a written exam, the case will often be handled without consulting the assessor.\n_**The decision**_ The decision on the matter may be one of the following:\n1. The student is offered a new assessment (re-assessment) of a written assignment by new assessors.\n2. The student is offered a new exam (re-exam) by new assessors if necessary.\n3. The student’s complaint is not upheld.\n4. If the exam includes both a written assignment and an oral exam, the student is offered a combination of 1., 2., and 3.\n\n\nNeither the assessor nor the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs has the opportunity to make a decision to raise or lower the student's grade.\nIf the student is offered a new assessment or exam, the student has two weeks to accept the offer via The Exam Complaint System. Acceptance of the offer is binding on the student, and the new assessment will replace the student's original assessment which is cancelled. The student must know that a new assessment or exam may result in a lower grade. It is not possible to complain about the new assessment/the new exam unless the complaint concerns legal issues.\n_**Appeal of decision**_ _Appeal of academic issues_ If the student does not accept the decision on his/her exam complaint,  _academic issues_ in the decision can be appealed to a board of appeals. The appeal must be filed within two weeks of the announcement of the decision to the student via the Exam Complaint System. It must be justified in writing and submitted to studenterklager@dtu.dk using the student email address. The case number from the exam complaint in the Exam Complaint System must appear in the appeal.\nThe decision is made by a board of appeals of 4 members appointed specifically to make a decision on the matter, comprising two external examiners, a lecturer, and a student within the relevant subject area. The decision of the board of appeals may be:\n1. The student is offered a new assessment (re-assessment) of a written assignment by new assessors.\n2. The student is offered a new exam (re-exam), usually by new assessors,\n3. The student is offered a combination of 1st and 2nd if the exam includes both a written assignment and oral exam or\n4. The student’s complaint is not upheld.\n\n\nThe board of appeals is in no position to lower or higher the student’s grade. The decision of the board of appeals cannot be further appealed to other authorities with respect to academic issues, and the decision from the board is final.\n_Complaint against legal issues_ Complaints against  _legal issues_ can be referred to The Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science. Legal issues can be e.g. non-compliance with the educational rules that apply to the education and whether other legislation (e.g. the Public Administration Act) and the general principles of administrative law have been complied with. The deadline for submission of an appeal is two weeks from the day the decision is announced to the student. The appeal must be submitted to the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs via [studenterklager@dtu.dk](http://studenterklager@dtu.dk.). In the appeal, the case number from the exam complaint in the Exam Complaint System must appear.\nWhen DTU receives an appeal about a decision, the decision is reassessed based on the information the student provided in the appeal. In this connection, DTU may decide to reopen the case if the appeal contains information that is of significant importance to the case or if significant case-handling errors have occurred in the original processing of the case.\nIf DTU chooses to maintain the original decision, DTU will prepare a statement about the decision and the appeal. The statement will be sent to the student who has the opportunity to comment on it. Finally, the entire case will be sent to the Agency for their consideration. The processing time at the Agency is currently approximately six months.\n**_Errors and deficiencies in exams_** If the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs or a board of appeals in connection with the processing of an exam complaint becomes aware that there have been errors and deficiencies in an exam, the Office makes a decision on how the error or deficiency can be remedied. This may be with or without the participation of the original assessors. The Office's processing of this type of case does not follow the rules on exam complaints but the Examination Order.\nIf the student's exam complaint contains significant complaints that do not relate to the errors and deficiencies that occurred during the exam, the Office will also decide regarding these complaints.\nIn the event of errors or deficiencies of a particularly serious nature, or where it must be considered the most correct way to remedy the error or deficiency, the Office may cancel the exam and arrange for an extraordinary new exam.\nIn the event of other significant errors and omissions, the Office may offer the student an extraordinary new exam. The offer must be given to all students whose exam suffers from the error or deficiency in question. A student may choose to retain the original assessment, even if they have participated in the extraordinary re-exam.\nExam certificate/diploma\nWhen a student has completed a study programme at DTU, DTU issues an exam certificate/diploma. The exam certificate lists all the exams the student has passed within the student’s curriculum.\nThe exam certificate is dated with the date on which the study programme ended:\n* If the final element is a BEng project, a BSc project, or an MSc thesis, the exam certificate/diploma will be dated with the oral presentation date.\n* If the final element is a course, the exam certificate/diploma will be dated with the date the last course was assessed.\n\n\nIf the student has completed their study programme after 15 June 2023, they will get a digital exam certificate. The exam certificate can be accessed via [www.diplomasafe.com](http://www.diplomasafe.com) within six weeks of the date of completion of the programme. The month of July is not included in the calculation. The student will receive a message on the student email, where they will be guided step by step in the Diplomasafe system when the diploma can be accessed. The diploma will remain available via [www.diplomasafe.com](http://www.diplomasafe.com).\nAs a starting point, the introductory email will contain a link where the student is forwarded to the diplomasafe.com login. Here, the student is asked to register as a user, with the message not to use the student email, as this email is deactivated three months after the end of the studies. If the student has nevertheless used their student email and the email has been deactivated, the student must contact the Study Administration by writing to studadm@adm.dtu.dk to gain access to Diplomasafe.\nAfter registering as a user, the student can access their exam certificate. When the student has entered the diploma, a purchase button will appear on the page, which can be used in connection with the purchase of a diploma if desired. A physical diploma with the DTU emblem can be purchased additionally for a fee of DKK 500.\nStudents who are withdrawn from a study programme at DTU without completing it will receive documentation for any completed parts of the programme stated in ECTS credits.\n**Specifically for students who graduated before 15 June 2023** If a student has graduated from DTU before 15 June 2023, they will have been sent a physical diploma by post. If the student has lost their diploma, it is possible to order a copy of the diploma by writing to the Study Administration at verification@adm.dtu.dk.",
    "Credit Transfer, Studying Abroad, Exemption, Leave, etc.": "Credit transfer means replacing elements forming part of the student’s study programme at DTU with courses or exams passed at another Danish or foreign educational institution. DTU may grant credit transfer upon submission of an application.\nCredit transfer from previous study programmes at the same level (pre-commencement credit transfer)\n* [Exam attempts in DTU courses](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Exam)\n* [Non-transferrable programme elements](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Non-transferrable)\n* [Programme deadlines in relation to pre-commencement credit transfer](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Programme)\n* [Decision-making authority](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Decision-making)\n* [Appeal against decision](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Appeal)\n\n\nUpon admission to DTU’s BEng, BSc, and MSc programmes, students are obliged to apply for credit transfer for passed programme elements (courses, etc.) from all previous _non-completed_ ordinary study programmes at the same level. This may, for example, be the case if an applicant to a BSc programme has previously been admitted to another BEng or BSc programme without having completed the programme.\nAn application for a pre-commencement credit transfer must be filed through www.merit.dtu.dk. Information on the process will be provided in the admission letter from DTU.\nIf students do not submit an application for credit transfer for previously passed programme elements at the same level or submit incorrect or incomplete information thereon, DTU may retract their enrolment at the university.\nIf the Head of Studies deems that credit transfer for programme elements can be granted to the mandatory parts of the programme, students will be granted credit transfer.\nIf it is deemed that credit transfer for programme elements to a mandatory course/project can only be granted partially, it is up to the student to decide whether he/she wants the partial credit transfer. Once the student has used an exam attempt in the mandatory course/project, the decision not to have the partial credit transfer is binding. The transfer is only possible if the partial credit amounts to a minimum of 5 ECTS credits and a minimum of half of the ECTS scope of the course/project.\nIf it is deemed that credit transfer for programme elements can be granted to the elective category of the programme, students can decide whether they want credit transfer. The optional credit transfer is registered by applying through www.merit.dtu.dk. It is entirely up to the student how much of the optional credit they wish to use and when.\nOnce granted, a credit transfer for both mandatory and elective parts of the programme cannot be withdrawn.\nStudents who wish to apply for credit transfer for educational elements from previously completed study programmes at the same level or passed educational elements from previously completed or uncompleted educational courses at a higher level can do so _._\nFor the BEng and BSc programmes, the courses must at least be at a professional bachelor or BEng level. For the MSc programmes, the courses must at least be at the master's level. MSc students may, however, have up to 10 ECTS credits at the bachelor's level as part of the elective courses in their programme.\nBEng students who have completed an academy profession programme before admission can apply for credit transfer for parts of the programme provided an established credit transfer agreement has been concluded. For information on currently established credit transfer agreements, please send an email to merit@adm.dtu.dk.\nWhen granted a pre-commencement credit transfer, students can still obtain a diploma from DTU even though credit transfer has been granted for more than half of the programme.\n**Exam attempts in DTU courses** Exam attempts on failed DTU courses in the previous field of study will only be transferred if such courses are mandatory in the new study programme or are not applicable to a course in the new study programme. Failed courses that can only be transferred as semi-mandatory or elective courses will not be transferred unless the student wishes to take these courses as part of the new study programme.\nStudents who are admitted to DTU via quota 1 or 2 and who have used exam attempts on failed courses they have previously attended at DTU on another study programme will automatically be assigned three new exam attempts on the relevant courses if these courses may be included in the study programme.\n**Non-transferrable programme elements** Students cannot be granted transfer of credits from the qualifying programme/exam.\nA final project from another educational programme cannot be transferred as a substitution for the final project to a DTU study programme. The project or elements of the project can only be transferred to the student’s programme as a substitution for other programme elements (courses) and if approved by the Head of Study.\nCourses/educational elements passed more than five years before admission to DTU cannot - as a general rule - be transferred to the student's enrollment. However, the relevant head of study may make an exemption from this rule based on a specific academic assessment. Whether an exemption can be granted is assessed by the Head of Study in connection with the assessment of the readmission application. Courses that date back more than five years will only be transferred to the applicant's new study programme if the applicant wishes to do so.\n**Programme deadlines in relation to pre-commencement credit transfer** The maximum study duration is reduced by one semester for every 30 ECTS credits the student has been granted in pre-commencement credit transfer. In the industry MSc Eng Programmes, the maximum study period will be reduced by one semester for every 15 ECTS credits the student has already passed.\nSuppose the student has been granted pre-commencement credit transfer on courses that are included in the first-year exam. To pass the first-year exam, the student is only required to pass the remaining elements.\n**Decision-making authority** The Board of Exemptions for the BSc and MSc programmes (CMDU) and the Board of Exemptions for the BEng programmes (DMDU) have authorized the heads of studies and the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs (AUS) to make decisions in cases related to credit transfer.\nA decision on credit transfer is not valid until the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs (AUS) issues a written decision to the student via email or at www.merit.dtu.dk.\n**Appeal against decision** If the student does not get their application granted, the student can appeal the decision via email to merit@adm.dtu.dk.\nCredit transfer during the study programme\n* [Choice of courses](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Choice)\n* [Pre-approval of credit transfer](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Pre-approval)\n* [Final credit transfer](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Final)\n* [Submission of applications](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Submission)\n* [Decision-making authority](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Decision-making)\n* [Appeal against decision](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Appeal)\n* [Students who have completed MSc courses on their Beng or BSc programme](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Students)\n\n\nCourses must be ‘passed' to be transferred to the programme.\nFor BEng programmes, transferred courses must be at the BEng level minimum, i.e. from an engineering college, a university college, or a university.\nFor BSc programmes, transferred courses must be at the university level. However, BSc students may have as many as 10 ECTS credits at the BEng level as part of the Elective Courses in their BSc programme (valid from 1 September 2020).\nFor MSc programmes, transferred courses must be at the MSc level. However, MSc students may have as many as 10 ECTS credits at the BSc level as part of the Elective Courses in their MSc programme.\nStudents cannot get pre-approved to transfer credit above the prescribed total ECTS credits for the study programme and must always try to plan their study according to the prescribed total ECTS credits for the programme. Also, see student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/Teaching'/'Course registration'/'Rules for choice of courses'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/course-registration#Rules)\nStudents cannot have pre-approved or credit-transferred courses that are to replace one or more courses the student is bound by. The head of studies cannot grant the student an exemption from this rule. See the rules on binding courses under [Study rules/Teaching/Binding courses.](http://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/undervisning/regler/regler-for-undervisning/bindende-kurser)\nAs a minimum, BEng and BSc students must pass courses and projects at DTU corresponding to 90 ECTS credits (BEng Arctic Technology and Fisheries Technology minimum105 ECTS credits and BEng Global Business Engineering minimum 120 ECTS credits) to receive a diploma for a full-time study programme at DTU. This rule does not apply to pre-commencement credit transfers.\nMSc students must pass courses and projects at DTU corresponding to 60 ECTS credits at minimum to receive a diploma for a full-time study programme at DTU. This rule does not apply to pre-commencement credit transfers.\n**Choice of courses** Regarding credit transfer to BSc and MSc programmes, a distinction is made between specific engineering courses and general engineering courses. Courses that do not have technical-scientific content but fall within the learning objectives of the study programme are categorized as general engineering courses. These courses are considered part of the elective courses. Students may earn the following number of ECTS credits within the general engineering course category:\n* 15 ECTS credits on the BSc programme\n* 10 ECTS credits on the MSc programme\n\n\n_Language and culture courses_ Language and culture courses cannot be transferred to the programme. neither in connection with pre-commencement credit transfer.\n_Final projects_ A final project from another Danish or foreign educational institution cannot be transferred to a study programme at DTU. Further rules regarding final projects (BEng project, BSc project, and Master's thesis), including the possibility of preparing the project abroad, are stated in the [programme specifications for the said programme.](http://studieinformation.dtu.dk/english)\n_MSc students passed MSc courses at their bachelor's programme_ On student.dtu.dk, under '[Study rules'/'Teaching'/'Course registration'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/course-registration), you can read about the situation where a master's student on his/her BSc or BEng programme has passed a course that is a general competence course or a technological specialization course in his/her master's programme, and which course the student should choose instead.\n_Courses taken as single subjects_ The student should be aware that courses taken as single subjects while enrolled in a regular full-time programme at DTU cannot be credited toward this full-time programme at a later time.\n**Pre-approval of credit transfer** Before taking a course or going abroad, students are obliged to apply for pre-approval of credit transfer for planned programme elements from another university or institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad.\nThe student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme's maximum allowed ECTS credits. If the student plans with odd credits in relation to DTU's credit structure of 2½, 5, and 10 ECTS, the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works. This can be done, for example, by using EuroTeQ courses or project courses.\nIf the pre-approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester, the student must submit a new application for a pre-approval of credit transfer. Each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university. A new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions.\nBy applying, students consent to DTU requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students cannot procure the documentation themselves.\nThe pre-approval of credit transfer is registered in the study administration system but will not appear in the Study Planner until the student has passed the courses and applied for final credit.\nIt is impossible to pre-approve more ECTS credits than there is room for in the student's study programme/framework.\n**Final credit transfer** The student must apply for final credit for all passed courses and ECTS credits. It is a requirement that all passed ECTS credits must be credited. The student can, therefore, not choose to only apply for credit transfer for some of the passed courses or ECTS points. Once a course has been passed, final credit must be sought, and the credit is binding to the student and cannot be withdrawn. However, according to DTU's specific assessment, fewer ECTS may be transferred if this is necessary for the study plan to fit the limit of ECTS credits in the study programme. Programme elements that have been credit transferred will be recorded on the student's DTU diploma with the grade 'Passed'. That applies to pre-commencement credit transfers and credit transfers during the study programme. However, if a programme element from another Danish educational institution assessed on the 7-point grading scale is credited as equivalent to a specific DTU course, the grade from that institution will be recorded.\nWith their application, the student consents that DTU can obtain necessary information for the application, which the student cannot obtain at the host university.\n**Submission of applications** Applications for pre-approval of credit transfer and final credit transfer are submitted electronically via [www.merit.dtu.dk.](http://www.merit.dtu.dk/) Other inquiries regarding credit transfer are sent to merit@adm.dtu.dk via the student email.\nApplications must include the following:\n* Course description\n* Documentation of level\n* Documentation of workload (ECTS/credits)\n* For final credit transfer, documentation of passed and failed courses and an official description of the grading scale according to which the course is assessed.\n\n\n**Decision-making authority** The Board of Exemptions for the BSc and MSc programmes (CMDU) and the Board of Exemptions for the BEng programmes (DMDU) have authorized the heads of studies and the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs (AUS) to make decisions in cases related to credit transfer. A decision on credit transfer is not valid until the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs (AUS) issues a written decision to the student via email or [www.merit.dtu.dk](http://www.merit.dtu.dk). The overall processing time for credit transfer applications is approximately 8 weeks from the date the application is received. The processing time may be longer if there is incomplete information or documentation.\n**Appeal against decision** If the student does not get their application granted, they can appeal the decision via email to merit@adm.dtu.dk.\nIf the complaint concerns the academic assessment of final credit transfer for Danish educational elements (including pre-commencement credit transfer) or pre-approval of credit transfer for Danish and foreign educational elements, it is processed by a credit transfer appeals board. That only applies if the decision concerns a BSc or MSc student. The deadline for lodging this type of complaint is two weeks from the day the decision letter is sent to the complainant. Complaints regarding legal matters can be submitted to the Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science. Legal matters concern compliance with applicable law in handling a case, including whether the educational regulations for the programme have been followed and whether other laws (e.g., the Public Administration Act) and general administrative legal principles have been adhered to. The complaint must be submitted to the Offivce for Study Programmes and Student Affairs via email to merit@adm.dtu.dk no later than two weeks after the decision has been communicated to the student by email or via [www.merit.dtu.dk](http://www.merit.dtu.dk).\nStudying abroad\nA thorough description of the possibilities for studying abroad and the application deadlines can be found at DTU’s website [Studyabroad.dtu.dk](http://www.studyabroad.dtu.dk/) and [Beyondborders.dtu.dk](http://beyondborders.dtu.dk/Pages/default.aspx)\nTo be eligible for an exchange place, students must meet the following criteria:\n* Students enrolled in a BSc or BEng programme must have completed at least two years of study (approximately 120, minimum 110, ECTS credits) before the commencement of the exchange stay unless the student is attending summer school abroad.\n* Students must be enrolled in an ordinary full-time DTU programme at the time of application and during the entire exchange stay. They must also have credit availability for transferring a minimum of 20 ECTS credits from their stay abroad.\n\n\nStudents are expected to be full-time students (30 ECTS credits per semester). Students must have space in their curriculum to obtain pre-approval and credit transfer of a minimum of 20 ECTS points from their study abroad. Students who do not comply with this requirement may be requested to repay any grants received from DTU. All pre-approved courses that have been passed must be transferred to the study programme.\nStudents must always comply with other study activity requirements and deadlines laid down by DTU, the host university, and other relevant bodies. Information on DTU's study activity requirements and deadlines is available on student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules/Rules for study activity requirements and deadlines](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/credit-transfer-studying-abroad/studying-abroad)'. Students are expected to pass and transfer at least 20 ECTS credits per semester (however, not students attending summer school abroad) and comply with other study activity requirements made by DTU, the host university, and other relevant bodies. Students who do not comply with this requirement may be requested to repay any grants received from DTU.\nStudents must apply for a pre-approved credit transfer for planned programme elements from another institution of higher education in Denmark or abroad before the course/stay is commenced, unless it involves language courses and/or summer school stays.

See the announcement and the new rules in[Study Announcement s1895](http://student.dtu.dk/meddelelser-og-opslag/studiemeddelelser/studiemeddelelse-s1895-vaesentlige-regelaendringer-for-studieaaret-20242025?id=e2bdbffb-3c6e-411b-9cbc-78a644e66ced)._**_Transferring to an MSc programme (transitional semester)_**\nStudents lacking 55 ECTS credits or less in their BEng/BSc programme at DTU can apply to take MSc courses worth a total of up to 30 ECTS credits, provided that they wish to apply for admission to an MSc programme at DTU and meet the admission requirements and academic prerequisites for admission into the MSc programme in question. The student cannot be granted an exemption to take more than a total of 30 ECTS credits, regardless of how many semesters the student follows the transitional procedure.\nThe desired MSc courses can be project courses. In that case, the student in their application must specify the department that delivers the special course and how many ECTS credits the individual special course constitutes.\nStudents must take courses or the final project as part of their BEng or BSc programme concurrently with the courses forming part of the future MSc programme. However, this rule can be waived if there are special study-related circumstances. Transfer to the MSc programme must not cause an extension of the study period for the BSc Eng/BEng programme beyond the maximum duration of the programme.\nThe student must file their application via a digital form found at [student.dtu.dk under ‘Study rules’ / ‘Transferring to an MSc programme’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/transferring-to-msc-programme). The application must be filled in and sent from the student email to kandidatopt@adm.dtu.dk. The decision regarding the application will be sent to the student email.\nWhen processing the application, DTU emphasises whether the student is deemed to have the academic prerequisites to complete courses on the MSc programme concurrently with completing the BSc/BEng programme.\nDeadline for applications:\n* 13-week periods: Three weeks after the beginning of the semester at the latest\n* 3-week periods in June, July, and August: 1 May\n* 3-week period in January: 1 November\n\n\nStudents can only apply for one semester at a time. The autumn semester runs from September to and including January, and the spring semester runs from February to and including August.\nStudents who have taken MSc courses concurrently with completing their BSc/BEng programme must still comply with the study activity requirement of 5 ECTS following admission to the MSc programme. The number of transferred ECTS credits will not be deducted from the study activity requirement.\nThe maximum study duration is reduced by one semester if students have passed 30 ECTS credits of MSc courses under the transitional procedure.\n_**Registration for courses under a transitional procedure**_ Course registration under the transitional procedure must be done via the digital application form. If the student wishes to change his/her course during the transitional semester, including unsubscribing for a course, this must be done by sending a new, updated application form to the Study Administration via student email at studadm@adm.dtu.dk.\n_**Application for a master's programme after the transitional procedure**_ The student must apply for admission to the master's programme when they are about to complete the BEng or BSc programme. See more about applying for the master's programmes at dtu.dk under ['How to apply for MSc programmes'](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/admission-and-deadlines).\n_**MSc courses passed under the transitional procedure**_ MSc courses passed under the transitional procedure will automatically be transferred from the BEng/BSc programme when the student is admitted to the MSc programme.\nIf the student chooses a different MSc study programme than that originally planned, only passed MSc courses, which are mandatory for the new study programme, will be transferred. The student can always ask to have passed electives transferred. The same rules then apply when changing the study programme.\n_**MSc courses not passed under the transitional procedure**_ MSc courses not passed under the transitional procedure are binding to the student, cf. the rules on binding courses. That also applies to elective courses if the student applies for admission to the same MSc programme that they chose during the transitional procedure. Find more information on student.dtu.dk under '[Study Rules'/'Teaching'/ 'Binding Courses](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/teaching/binding-courses)'. Thus, not passed courses will be transferred from the BEng/BSc programme when the student is admitted to the MSc programme.\nIf the student applies to do a different MSc study programme than that originally planned, his or her binding registration for a failed course will be cancelled unless the course is mandatory in the new study programme.\n_**SU on completion of BEng/BSc programme**_ The BEng/BSc programme is completed when the grade in the last course/project on the study programme has been registered. That also applies even if the final grade is registered in the middle of the semester and even if the courses in the semester that the transfer of courses concerns are not yet concluded.\nWhen the BEng/BSc programme is completed, the student will no longer be entitled to receive SU or a completion loan because the student is no longer enrolled in a study programme, even though the student is still following courses in the semester that the transfer of courses concerns.\n**_Early start of studies at the MSc programme_**\nOnce you have passed your qualifying degree to the MSc programme (and passed any supplementary courses), you may apply for an early start of studies. It is possible to take courses from the MSc programme in the 3-week periods leading up to the start of studies. If you start the MSc programme on 1 February, you can, therefore, take a course in January, and if you start the MSc programme on 1 September, you can take courses in July and August.\nIt is a condition for early study start that you have completed the qualifying degree.\nIf you want to apply to take courses before the formal start of studies on the MSc programme, you must write from your student email to kandidopt@adm.dtu.dk and state which course(s) you wish to follow with course numbers. This is also evident in your admission letter.\nInformation about the possibility of receiving the State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme (SU) for early start of studies can be found on student.dtu.dk under '[SU (State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme)](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/su-state-educational-grant-and-loan-scheme)'.\nWhen you get a reply that it is possible to take the course, you must register for the course yourself at Studieplan.dtu.dk. Registration must be done within the registration and deregistration deadlines for the teaching period in question.

A student can apply for leave multiple times during their study period.\n1. Right to leave of absence (maternity/paternity leave, adoption and military service)\n2. Leave of absence for special reasons (e.g., personal illness or illness of a close relative)\n3. Leave of absence without reason\n\n\n** _Right to leave of absence (maternity/paternity leave, adoption, and military service)_** Students have the right to be granted leave from their studies for up to one continuous year per leave period, provided they submit the necessary documentation showing they are taking maternity leave, have adopted a child, or are required to perform military service.\nMore information about options for students who become parents during their studies can be found on student.dtu.dk under [\"Study Rules\"/\"Maternity/paternity leave during education\"](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/maternity-paternity-leave)._**Leave of absence due to special reasons (e.g., personal illness or illness of a close relative)**_\n* **Personal, long-term illness, including mental illness** Documentation could be a medical certificate or other medical statement indicating that the student cannot study due to illness. The documentation must specify when the student is or is expected to be ill.\n* **Illness of a close relative** That could involve caring for or supporting a close relative who is disabled, seriously ill, or dying. Close relatives are typically parents, grandparents, children, and spouses/partners. Other individuals may also be considered close relatives if the student explains why they should be considered close relatives and provides medical documentation proving the person is seriously ill.\n* **Elite athletes** Learn more about being a student and an elite athlete on student.dtu.dk under '[Help and guidance/Study guidance/Elite sports](http://student.dtu.dk/en/vejledning/studievejledningen/elitesport)'.\n* **Other special circumstances** Other circumstances that prevent the student from actively studying. These circumstances must not be self-imposed, and the special circumstances must be documented.\n\n\nDeadlines related to the program, including the first-year exam and the maximum study time, are extended by the leave period, calculated in whole semesters.\n_**Extension of leave beyond one year**_ If the student wishes to extend an ongoing leave period beyond one year with the same reason, the student must apply for an exemption to extend the leave period via [www.dispensation.dtu.dk](http://www.dispensation.dtu.dk). Extensions of leave can only be granted with a special justification. Read more about submitting an exemption application on student.dtu.dk under '[Study Rules'/'Leave of absence](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/leave-of-absence)'.\n_**Leave of absence without reason**_ Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Engineering students can apply for leave of absence without providing a reason once they have completed at least 60 ECTS credits. For Bacheor of Engineering programmes, these 60 ECTS credits must constitute the first year of study as per the curriculum. For Bachelor of Science in Engineering students, the 60 ECTS credits must be earned from mandatory courses (elective courses do not count).\nMaster’s students can apply for leave once they have completed 30 ECTS credits from mandatory courses (elective courses do not count).\nLeave can be granted for up to one semester. The leave period cannot be extended.\n_**Leave during the final project**_ When applying for a leave of absence during the final project, the application must be accompanied by a statement from the project supervisor. It is the supervisor who, based on an academic assessment, determines whether the project deadline can be postponed corresponding to the leave period. If the supervisor cannot support a longer-term postponement of the project, that means the project cannot be extended during the leave period, and the student has used an exam attempt unless the student can provide documentation of illness, in which case the student receives the registration 'SYG' (ill). Read more about this registration at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exam'/'Assessment forms and grading](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exam/assessment-forms-and-grading)'.\nThe relevant curriculum describes what opportunities the student has to apply for an extension of the submission deadline for the final project, e.g., in case of illness. See student.dtu.dk under ['Study rules'/'Rules for final projects](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/afsluttende-projekter)'.\n_**Application for leave of absence**_ The student must send their leave application along with documentation to the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs at studadm@adm.dtu.dk from their student email. The application form can be found on student.dtu.dk under [\"Study Rules\"/\"Leave of absence\"](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/leave-of-absence).\nThe application must be submitted no later than three weeks into the leave period the student is applying for. A leave period may fall in the middle of a semester. Leave of absence cannot be granted retroactively beyond three weeks.\n**_Consequences of the three types of leave of absence_** All study activities must stop during the period of leave. That includes participation in courses, exams and the submission of assignments/projects. Students will not receive monthly grants (SU) during their leave of absence. Questions on SU must be addressed to the SU team in the Office for Study Programmes and Student Affairs. Find contact information at student.dtu.dk under '[Help and guidance/The SU Office.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/vejledning/su-kontoret)\nStudents should also be aware that there may be special rules for study activity requirements for study accommodation/dormitories. Questions about this must be directed to the housing association/dormitory company in question.\nStudents may only exercise their voting rights and retain their eligibility during a leave of absence period exceeding six months if the leave expires at the beginning of the term of office at the latest.\nDuring the period of leave, students must stay updated on study announcements posted by DTU.\n**_Termination of leave prematurely_** Students who want to return to their studies before the end of their leave of absence must write to the Study Information at studadm@adm.dtu.dk from their student mail.\nDeadlines that have been postponed (first-year exam and maximum duration of study time) are not adjusted unless the student terminates the leave early by a full semester. In that case, the postponement of deadlines will be revised accordingly.\n**_Students who are in conflict with DTU's rules of study_** If the student submitted an exemption application due to conflict with DTU's rules of study before their leave, the student may withdraw the application if a final exemption decision has not been made yet. Once an exemption decision has been made, this decision will be binding and cannot be annulled.\n**_Special rules for non-EU-EEA students with a residence permit in Denmark_** A student who is a non-EU/EEA citizen waiver student and has a Danish student residence permit should be aware that his/her student residence permit may be revoked by the Danish immigration authorities (SIRI), even if DTU grants a leave of absence. According to the law, DTU must inform SIRI when this group of students get a leave of absence from the university. Revocation of the student's residence permit by SIRI means that the student has to leave Denmark immediately. When the students are ready to resume their studies, they must apply for a new Danish student residence permit from their home country.\nBachelor of Science in Engineering students can get more information on this by writing to optagelse@adm.dtu.dk. Master students can get more information by writing to mscadmissions@adm.dtu.dk\nSU (State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme)\nRules on SU can be found on the Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science website: [www.su.dk](http://www.su.dk/). All rules governing SU can be found in the Danish Act on the State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme _(SU-loven)_ and the Ministerial Order on the Danish State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme _(SU-bekendtgørelsen)_ , (see [‘Love og bekendtgørelser](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/undervisning/regler/bekendtgoerelser)’). These rules constitute the basis for decisions made by the SU office at DTU.\nFurther information about SU can be found at [student.dtu.dk under ‘SU (State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme)’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/su-state-educational-grant-and-loan-scheme).\nStudents should note the differences between DTU’s study-related rules and the legislation governing the State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme. Therefore, exemptions from DTU’s study-related rules will not take account of SU issues. Likewise, SU-related decisions will not impact DTU’s study-related rules.\nThat means that students who are granted an exemption from DTU’s study-related rules do not necessarily comply with the terms of the Danish Act on the State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme for continuing to receive SU. Therefore, students may risk losing their SU despite any decisions made by DTU.\nWithdrawal from study programmes\nStudents who wish to withdraw from their study programme at DTU must fill out a [withdrawal form](http://student.dtu.dk/en/apply-for/udmeldelse) at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules’/‘Withdrawal from study programmes’](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/withdrawal-from-study-programmes). The filled-out form must be sent from the DTU student mail to studadm@adm.dtu.dk.\nPlease note a withdrawal cannot be cancelled.\nIt is not allowed to be enrolled in more than one full-time education at a time. If the student is admitted to another full-time programme outside DTU, he or she must actively withdraw from their studies at DTU. That does not happen automatically.\nIf the student is considering applying for admission to DTU later on, read more about the admission rules on student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Readmission](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/readmission)'. It is possible for students to temporarily interrupt their studies by applying for a leave of absence if it is justified in special documented circumstances. Read more about leave of absence at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Leave of absence'.](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/leave-of-absence) If the student is newly admitted to DTU and wishes to withdraw from the programme in the first semester before 30 September (summer start) and 28 February (winter start), withdrawal is made by contacting the admission office:\n* Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Science and Engineering students must contact optagelse@adm.dtu.dk\n* Master's students must contact mscadmissions@adm.dtu.dk\n\n\nIf the student has questions or needs guidance before withdrawing from their studies, [DTU Study Guidance](http://student.dtu.dk/en/vejledning/studievejledningen) can be contacted.\n_Special rules for non-EU/EEA students with a residence permit in Denmark_ A student who is a non-EU/EEA fee-paying OR waiver student and has a Danish student residence permit should be aware that his/her student residence permit may be revoked by the Danish immigration authorities (SIRI). DTU is obliged to inform SIRI when non-EU/EEA students withdraw from the University. Revocation of the student's residence permit by SIRI means that the student has to leave Denmark immediately.\nBachelor students: for more information on this, please write to optagelse@adm.dtu.dk.

In relation to the summer admission, that means an applicant must be unsubscribed by 1 April to be able to be readmitted for the semester start 1 September. If the applicant is applying for readmission and already has a completed master's degree, they will be subject to the master's rule, which means that they can only be admitted if there are available seats in the programme.\n**_Applicants who are in conflict with DTU's study rules_** Applicants who have been disenrolled from their study programme by DTU because of a violation of DTU's rules (the first-year exam, used up exam attempts or maximum duration of the study, etc.) or who are in violation of those rules at the time of application for readmission will need to apply for an exemption. Such an application is only to be submitted once DTU has notified the applicant that they must apply for an exemption. Please note, that an exemption must be applied for regardless of whether the student is applying for a place on a different study programme than the one in which the student was previously enrolled.\nIn connection with the application for exemption, DTU assesses whether the applicant's opportunities to complete the education have significantly improved since they were last enrolled at DTU. This assessment can, i.a., include academic and health conditions. The applicant must thus not apply for an exemption for the rule with which they were in conflict. Instead, they should focus on why the opportunities to complete the study programme have been improved.\nIf the application for an exemption is accepted, it will be assessed whether the applicant can be readmitted. If it cannot be accepted, the student’s application for readmission will be rejected.\nRead more about exemption from DTU's rules at student.dtu.dk under '[Study rules'/'Exemption'](http://student.dtu.dk/en/rules/exemption).\n**_Limitation period for previously passed courses_** Courses/educational elements passed more than five years before readmission to DTU cannot - as a general rule - be transferred to the student's new enrollment. However, the relevant head of study may, in special cases, make an exemption from this rule based on a specific academic assessment. Whether an exemption can be granted is assessed by the head of study in connection with the assessment of the readmission application. Courses that date back more than five years will only be transferred to the applicant's new study programme if the applicant wishes to do so.\n_**Application and application deadlines**_ Applications for readmission to the MSc programme are submitted via DTU’s ordinary admission to the MSc programme according to the applicable deadlines and admission requirements.\nSee more at [DTU’s website under ‘How to apply for MSc programmes’](http://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/admission-and-deadlines).\n_**Processing of the application**_ Applicants will be readmitted if all the following conditions are met:\n* The applicant has applied within the deadline for readmission.\n* The applicant meets the applicable admission requirements for the study programme on the date of admission.\n* The applicant is granted an exemption following any application for this.\n\n\n_**Deadlines, courses and exam attempts**_ The maximum study period for readmitted students is the prescribed study period + one year from the readmission date. The maximum study period will be reduced by one semester for every 30 ECTS credits the student has already passed. In the industry MSc Eng Programmes, the maximum study period will be reduced by one semester for every 15 ECTS credits the student has already passed.\nIf the student is readmitted to the same master's programme, all courses, both compulsory and optional, which the student has previously passed or failed in this programme, will automatically be transferred to the new enrollment and will, therefore, still be part of the student's new study plan.\nThe student is granted a new exam attempt on courses for which all exam attempts have been used if the course forms part of the study programme.\nChange of study programme and field of study on MSc Eng programmes\n* [Change of field of study in the MSc Eng programmes](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Change)\n* [Application and application deadlines](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Application)\n* [Processing of the application](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Processing)\n* [Change of study programme on MSc Eng programmes](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Change)\n* [Consequences of a change of field of study and study programme for MSc Eng students](https://sdb.dtu.dk/2024/136/2414#Consequences)\n\n\n_**Change of field of study in the MSc Eng programmes**_\nIf a student wishes to change the field of study at DTU, DTU has to assess if the student can change the study programme or field of study.\nIf the student cannot change the field of study, it will be assessed whether the student can be admitted to the study programme.\nChange of field of study means that the student changes the field of study within the same study programme, i.e. from one MSc Eng programme to another MSc Eng programme\n** _Application and application deadlines_** Students who wish to change their field of study in an MSc Eng programme at DTU must apply for admission to the new field of study following the applicable deadlines for admission.

If the student wishes to include previously failed courses in the new MSc field of study, the number of used exam attempts for the course will be transferred to the student’s new MSc field of study.\nStudents who have used all their exam attempts on one or more courses that are included in the new field of study must apply for an exemption for additional exam attempts. Such an exemption can only be applied for after the change of field of study. The students are responsible for checking whether they need to apply for an exemption. DTU does not provide information to students who change the field of study on their MSc Eng programme about whether they need to apply for an exemption for used-up exam attempts.\nStudents who change their field of study must also register for the courses they wish to take in the new field of study.",
