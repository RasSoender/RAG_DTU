The main fields we will be concerned with are discrete mathematics, linear algebra and algebra.\n\nError-correcting codes is not about programming, but about representing digital information in ways that are resilient to noise. It is used everywhere: in a DVD which can play flawlessly even though it is scratched, or a satellite-transmission which is understood through bad atmospheric disturbance in stormy weather, or in high-speed internet and in mobile phone conversations. Without exaggerating, the information era would have been impossible without Coding Theory.\n\nMany of the best error-correcting codes we know are based on ingenious algebraic methods. This course is an introduction to the fundamental mathematical model in coding theory and to the mathematics behind these algebraic codes. In order for the recipient to correct whatever errors appear, efficient algorithms will be needed for handling the algebraic objects; we will deal with this using both theoretical algebra and using a computer-algebra system.\n\nIn a nutshell: we will use algebra and develop algebraic methods to find good solutions to mathematical problems inspired by applications of Error-correcting Codes.",

Vi consider an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes and show how it can be implemented in a computer algebra system. After this we generalize to Reed-Muller codes using multivariate polynomials.

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo be able to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems and understand their complexity. Many models in science and engineering are differential equations describing the evolution of some variables. Dynamical systems theory is the study of such evolution aiming to answer questions like: What is the long term dynamics? How does the system depend on parameters? These are very important questions in applications and hence dynamical systems theory is a very important topic in science and engineering. Dynamical systems is also a fascinating field of mathematics as it combines most of the core mathematical disciplines, in particular, analysis and geometry.\nThe course will lay the mathematical foundation for the following more advanced courses: 01257 Advanced Modelling - Applied Mathematics, where the students get to apply dynamical systems theory to concrete problems in modelling\n01621 Advanced Dynamical Systems: Global Theory\n01622 Advanced Dynamical Systems with Applications in Science and Engineering",

Today, quantum programs are expressed as quantum circuits working on single qubits.\n\nBased on classic compiler-theory and quantum information, this course will cover the components needed to develop a quantum compiler, which can translate a high-level programming language into feasible quantum circuits and mapping these circuits onto the qubits of the target quantum computer architecture.",

Then some examples of such that problems are presented and methods are described to identify a problem as being hard. In order to become accessible to an analysis real world problems have to be converted into abstract mathematical models which capture the essence of the original problem.\n\nWe shall then look at problems where randomization helps in solving them. This means that there are fast algorithms for solving the problem that use \"coin flips'', i.e. a random number generator. Hence repeatedly running such an algorithm on the same input might lead to different solutions. We shall consider problems where a \"good'' solution will be found with high probability by randomized algorithms.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course connects the theory of molecular diffusion with the theory of differential equations driven by noise. It enables the student to build and examine models of how noise and uncertainty propagates in dynamic systems. This can be used for time series analysis, and for dynamic decision making under uncertainty, i.e. stochastic control. The course contains theory for stochastic differential equations, stochastic calculus, and applications to engineering problems.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine and describe diffusion and Brownian motion\nCompute stochastic integrals, most importantly the Ito integral, and apply the rules of stochastic calculus\nBuild stochastic dynamic models by combining ordinary differential equations with models of how noise affects the system\nExplain how a given stochastic differential equation corresponds to a certain advective-diffusive transport equation\nInvestigate the properties of a stochastic differential equation in terms of sample paths and transition probabilities, both analytically and numerically.\nImplement a state estimation filter for analyzing time series data based on a stochastic differential equation\nIdentify the optimal strategy to control a system in presence of noise\nEvaluate the importance of including noise in a study of a given system.",
        "Content": "The course starts with advective and diffusive transport, and Monte Carlo simulation of a molecule in flow. We then turn to Brownian motion and stochastic integrals, and establish the Ito integral. We define stochastic differential equations (sde's), and cover analytical and numerical techniques to solve them. We describe the transition probabilities of solutions to sde's, and establish the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations, including boundary conditions/boundary behavior. We consider stochastic filtering in sde's with discrete time measurements, stochastic stability, and stochastic control. The theory is illustrated with applications in engineering, physics, biology, and oceanography.",

The objectives are 1) to enable students to undertake a simple risk assessment, 2) to outline the components and principles of a basic risk management programme, and 3) to provide students with key insights so they know some pitfalls and limitations for the application of 1) and 2).\nThis is an introductory course that favours qualitative aspects of risk management over quantitative approaches. The course introduces the student to risk-based decisions. Particularly situations where information is partial, or events with a low chance of occurrence but with unacceptably large consequence. Participants are introduced to basic methods of risk analysis, assessment and management, to a large extent illustrated by the use of practical case examples.\nThese cases draw from a diverse selection of specialist topics, e.g. industrial accident prevention, civil aviation safety, marine transport, health care, and natural disaster emergency planning and response, amongst others.

Careful modeling of all contributions to uncertainty is the key to theoretical understanding and successful applications. With more flexible models such as those used in deep learning this becomes increasingly important but also difficult. In the course, Bayesian machine learning is used as it provides a unified approach to reason about uncertainty associated with both the data and the specification of the model.\n\nThe purpose of the course is two-fold. First of all, the goal is to equip students with a deeper theoretical understanding of probabilistic machine learning and to enable them to read and understand the newest research literature in the field. Second, to enable students to discuss probabilistic models for practical problems and to discuss and apply appropriate inference algorithms.",

You can use this in a wide range of areas from medicine to materials research. To use 3D imaging you need to combine knowledge from three areas: image acquisition, processing, and analysis. And of course, you need to know the sample you are studying. In this course, you will get the skills that will enable you to use 3D imaging as a research tool.\n\nThe methods we will discuss will be general and applicable to any 3D volumetric (i.e. made of voxels) images like those, for instance, from magnetic resonance imaging. However, a special emphasis will be put on 3D x-ray µCT imaging (micro-computed-tomography) because of our close relationship with the 3D imaging center at DTU and with the MAX IV synchrotron in Lund (a new world-class research facility that offers unique opportunities within 3D imaging).\n\nThe most difficult, but also fun and rewarding part of 3D imaging, is analyzing the images. In this course, you will get the practical skills to carry out advanced visualization and analysis, and you do not need to have worked with image analysis before. Throughout the course, you will use high-performance computing when analyzing large 3D images.",

You will do so from a mathematical/physical perspective and then the hands-on use/implementation with Python.\n\nYou will familiarize yourself with software tools for visualization and data exploration and learn to calculate statistics of the shape and sizes of the imaged structures.\n\nYou will learn about the management of performance when processing your data, how to measure execution time, use memory resources, and parallel computing.\n\n3D images are often very large, and a single image can be several GB, making data handling and processing challenging on a normal PC. Therefore, you will learn to use high-performance computing systems that enable the processing of large amounts of data. You will use the Gbar.\n\nThrough the course, you will gain the necessary confidence to write your code for developing image processing pipelines that are suitable for 3D imaging. You will gain prerequisites for working further within 3D imaging, image analysis, and/or high-performance computing.",

Classic applications are CAD systems for product design, game engines, computer animation, 3D multimedia, virtual reality, and scientific visualization. With the recent development in 3D scanning and printing technology, work with digitized real world objects has also become an important area of application.\n\nInteractive computer graphics enables us to manipulate digital 3D objects. The ability to work interactively with digital objects is an important engineering skill. Computer graphics is essential both in the classic disciplines, where we model and render digital objects, and in the full cycle from digitization to visualization and manipulation to printing of real world objects. In addition, modern internet browsers support hardware accelerated 3D graphics in webpages that run on both desktop and mobile platforms. This means that 3D graphics will also be used more broadly in the webpages of the future.\n\nThis course provides an overview of interactive computer graphics. Our objective is to enable the participants to (a) implement real-time computer graphics systems and (b) to develop graphics algorithms for and apply them in visualization, modelling, and animation.

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nRendering is to use a mathematical model on a computer for creating a digital image that looks like the real three-dimensional world. Computer animation for movies and games are classical examples where rendering is essential. Visualization of architecture and products under development (digital prototypes) is another important application area. It is also an advantage to use computer graphics rendering techniques for visualizing 3D simulations or measurements. Furthermore, it is increasingly more common to generate datasets consisting of synthetic images for machine learning.\n\nThe course objective is to introduce the ray tracing techniques commonly used in computer graphics systems for general/off-line rendering (photorealistic images, material appearance modelling, computer animation, scientific visualization, mapping techniques) as well as providing some experience with developing algorithms and implementing parts of such systems. In particular, the objective is to acquaint the participants with algorithms for simulating light-material interaction and to implement parts of a graphics system that can render relatively complicated objects, scenes, and illumination conditions.",

Examples include components of new drugs to combat diseases, superconductors and materials for solar energy harvesting and data storage. Neutron and X-ray scattering are complementary methods that allow investigations of structure and dynamics.\n\nThe course introduces a series of experimental techniques in neutron and X-ray scattering that allow the determination of all relevant structural parameters for molecules, amorphous systems and crystals, including the magnetic structure. Furthermore, elementary excitations of the relevant structural, electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom (such as changing molecular bonds, phonons and spin waves) can be studied in great detail, either directly in the ultrafast time domain or via their spectroscopic signatures. X-ray and neutron imaging creates 3 dimensional maps of the local structure within materials. Hence, these techniques provide the means to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that govern the connections between structure and function for a wide range of materials and over a wide range of time and length-scales.\n\nThe overall goal of the course is to provide a broad understanding of modern X-ray and neutron scattering, and a thorough introduction to the practical use of these techniques in the study of the structure and dynamics of materials.

The starting point is electromagnetic phenomena, in particular the electromagnetic fields around a point charge as observed in different inertial systems. Then follows a discussion on the form-invariance of the laws of physics as well as the two postulates of Einstein, and the Lorentz transformation is derived and used to prove Lorentz contraction, time dilation, and the concept of relativistic simultaneity. Transformation of particle position, velocity, and acceleration is treated, and invariant quantities are sen to lead to space-time diagrams, 4-vectors, and proper time. 4-vectors are applied to particle dynamics, energy-momentum 4-vector, the center-of-mass concept, as well as relativistic energy (kinetic and reaction energy), and energy-momentum conservation is applied to elastic scattering (the Compton effect). Relativistic Doppler effect is treated, followed by a relativistic description of plane waves, the 4-vector phase, and the group and phase velocity. Finally, elements of relativistic electrodynamics and the Lorentz transformation of the electromagnetic fields are treated, and the Dirac equation in the relativistic quantum theory of the electron is derived. The general theory of relativity is introducered in a breif overview and its importance for the GPS technology is discussed. Throughout the course are given examples of applications of the theory within electromagnetism, atomic physics, high energy physics, and astro physics,",

        "Remarks": "From the start of the course, you will be offered cleanroom safety training, and training sessions for use of specific cleanroom tools. This will take place Wednesdays 8-17, i.e. outside of the teaching modules. Unless you already have these skills, e.g. from 10851/10852, you must therefore be able to reserve a number of Wednesdays for these training sessions in addition to the scheduled course modules. You may consider those training sessions as part of the homework for the course. The training sessions will be agreed on an individual basis for all course students. In connection to the hands-on training sessions, you will also have to do self-study of online materials regarding the appropriate use of specific tools and safety measures. Subsequently, your understanding of these materials will be evaluated through a number of quizzes, which must be passed before the corresponding hands-on training can be agreed. During the mini-project phase, you must be prepared to be flexible regarding organization of your work, as availability of tools in the cleanroom may require working outside of the scheduled course modules.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide a general basic knowledge of environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology as a fundamental basis for understanding chemical pollution problems. Tools for evaluation of environmental fate and effects of chemicals are introduced in the context of environmental management and risk assessment.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine and describe fundamental concepts and terms in environmental toxicology, chemistry and risk assessment\nCollect relevant chemical fate and effect data from the internet and handbooks/databases\nInterpret physico-chemical data for chemicals in relation to environmental fate\nQuantify environmental behavior using equilibrium assumptions\nApply simple quantitative structure activity relationships in the estimation of inherent compound properties\nInterpret results of standardized biodegradability tests\nConduct laboratory ecotoxicity test with chemicals\nAnalyse data and evaluate results of ecotoxicological tests\nDescribe test results in a technical laboratory report\nClassify and assess chemicals in accordance with regulatory guidelines for environmental risk assessment\nSummarize and evaluate own and literature data in environmental profiles of organic chemicals",
        "Content": "The course deals with environmental exposure and effect assessment of organic chemicals. Exposure and effect assessments are key elements in both Danish and EU classifications and risk assessments of chemicals. The exposure assessment covers the environmental chemical fate i.e. transport, degradation, intermedia transfer and partitioning of chemicals in different parts of the environment. Here processes like biodegradation, hydrolysis, photodegradation, sorption, volatilization, and bioaccumulation are fundamental for understanding the environmental behaviour of chemicals. The processes are related to the physico-chemical and chemical structure properties and to the characteristics of the environmental compartments (water, aquatic sediments, aquatic biota, soil, and air). Calculation exercises and computer-based models for distribution of compounds are used to illustrate the environmental chemical fate. The effect assessment covers ecotoxicological effects of chemicals. This subject is taught through lectures dealing with the theoretical aspects of toxicity testing and regulatory use of toxicity data. Furthermore, collection of chemical property data and a series of theoretical and practical laboratory exercises are carried out in groups of 3 students. The laboratory exercises include standard tests for biodegradation and biological effects on different groups of organisms (e.g. bacteria, algae and crustaceans).",

The course puts LCIA modelling in the context of planetary boundaries to enable absolute environmental sustainability assessments (AESA), which aims to determine what it takes for human activities to become environmentally sustainable, as opposed to merely having better environmental performance than a reference activity. The competences gained from this course are useful for advancing impact assessment and communicating the results of LCAs and AESAs to experts and non-experts, which is valuable for pursuing careers in both industry and research.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the role of fate, exposure and effect factors in LCIA modelling.\nCalculate fate, exposure and effect factors for the eco-toxicity and human-toxicity impacts of different chemicals using the USEtox model.\nCompare and contrast the handling of fate, exposure and effect factors for eco-toxicity and human-toxicity in USEtox with their handling in LCIA models for other impact categories, such as climate change or water scarcity.\nDevelop LCIA models for linking elementary flows with indicators of planetary boundaries and other carrying capacities.\nDesign LCIA models and other techniques for quantifying carrying capacities.\nArgue for and against the use of specific principles for allocating carrying capacities to individual activities in AESA, considering fairness and practical applicability.\nInterpret the results of LCAs and AESAs considering uncertainties, methodological choices and value judgement, and communicate the results to both experts and non-experts.\nDevelop your own impact assessment model for a chosen environmental problem and use it to calculate characterization factors that you will then apply to a specific product life cycle in LCA software.",

This includes understanding the medical problem, evaluating the molecular methods applied and predicting the impact of introducing better diagnostics methods on the treatment results. The trends of molecular diagnostics will be analyzed, in particular how diagnostics contribute to giving patients correct treatments (e.g. biologicals such as antibodies, antibiotics, immunotherapy) including no treatment.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe methods used in molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time PCR, sequencing, next generation sequencing, microarrays, digital methods and laboratory automation.\ncompare performance of various quantitative methods such as digital PCR, next generation sequencing and digital ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).\nevaluate the efficacy of molecular diagnostics to solve a clinical problem.\nidentify weaknesses and limitations of methodologies for a given diagnostics situation.\nsummarize and evaluate current and future technologies for microbial, cancer and genetic diagnostics.\ndescribe how molecular diagnostics is guiding the treatment (genetic status used for precision medicine) and preventing diseases (e.g. multiplex analysis for sub classification of microorganism).\ndescribe and evaluate the diagnostics used to guide immunotherapy.\ndesign a molecular assay including primers and probes, and choose a proper statistically sound validation strategy.\npresent scientific material in clear and precise reports, posters and oral forms.\nanalyse a diagnostic problem and describe a strategy to improve tests by finding new biomarkers (biomarker discovery) or apply other methodology such as point of care- or cutting edge technologies.",
        "Content": "With the increased biological knowledge about, e.g., the human genome and the association between genes and diseases, molecular diagnostics is becoming an increasingly important tool for the health sector. In particular, molecular diagnostics is the basis for precision medicine, i.e. to provide the patient with best possible care in a given situation based on genetic information.\n\nThe course covers three clinical fields with increasing complexity of analysis and precision medicine.\n\nThe first part addresses microbiological diagnostics and associated techniques. Here the basic concepts of using virus or bacteria specific genes as biomarker for diagnosing infections are introduced. The course addresses the importance of multiplex test in order to map the genetics of the microorganism for patient stratification and different treatment options.\n\nIn the second part, monogenetic and polygenetic disorders and risk profiles are addressed. Here we aim to understand scope and impact of genetic variance on medical treatment and procedure. The associated techniques used in genetic analyses are explained and evaluated.\n\nIn the third part, cancer diagnostics and precision medicine are the focuses. Here, usage of genetic methods for quantitative measurements are addressed in order to either detect cancer at early stage or to monitor treatment results. Modern cancer drugs are very expensive and ideally only used on patients that can benefit from them. These decisions are based on molecular, often quantitative, methods. Examples to illustrate the approach is BCR/ABL transcript measurements and mutation analysis in CML patients, EGFR/Ras mutational analysis for treating colon cancers and analysis of for instance PDL1 expression for guiding immunotherapy.\n\nIncreasing usage of cutting-edge technologies such as high throughput sequencing and digital PCR combined with advanced sample preparation methods can address many kinds of samples such a cell free DNA (rare DNA), circulating tumour cells (rare cells) and exosomes (cell remnants). The course will investigate the diagnostic advantage and clinical and societal impact of such cutting-edge technologies.",

        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe common immediate, early, and late body responses to implanted materials.\ndescribe and compare the mechanical properties of different classes of biomaterials.\ndescribe processes to shape different classes of biomaterials.\nexplain and exemplify how surface engineering of biomaterials can enhance or reduce their interaction with living cells.\ndiscuss common degradation mechanism of biomaterials and possible associated adverse effects on living systems.\ndescribe methods to sterilize implantable materials and discuss their possible adverse effects on the properties of biomaterials.\ndescribe selected requirements for approval of a biomaterial for clinical use.\nanalyze the physical, chemical, and mechanical requirements of a biomaterial for a specific biomedical application.\ndesign a biomaterials based solution to a biomedical problem by combining a requirement analysis with knowledge on biomaterials properties and processing.\nassess and report on the pros and cons of a biomaterials based device.",
        "Content": "The fundamental materials science aspects of biomaterials, such as manufacture, structure, and properties, will be reviewed in close connection with practical operation, performance and failure mechanisms of biomedical devices and implants. Man-made materials (metals, ceramics, polymers) as wells as biological materials will be considered.\n\nWe will survey the many adverse effects that the introduction of a foreign material can induce in the body, including toxicity, immunological responses, and infection. This knowledge will be an outset for discussing how to maximize functionality and minimize adverse effects by proper choice of the biomaterial itself, design of the device shape and structure, and modification of its surface properties. Problem-based assignments will be based on examples of real-world devices in use or under development. Their current application and potential need for improvement will be discussed by guest lecturers from industry.\n\nBiomaterial stability and degradation mechanisms will be described. Examples will show how understanding and control of the degradation processes are equally important whether biomaterial degradation is needed as in a cell scaffold for tissue engineering or unwanted as in a permanent implant.\n\nThe clinical use of biomaterials requires prior evaluation and approval by medical authorities. We will consider selected requirements in more detail and discuss how they may delay or even prevent the introduction of new biomaterials for actual clinical application.",

Data, which describes proportions, counts, percentages, or concentrations are compositional and cannot be analyzed as real multivariate data. However, using appropriate transformations, compositional data can be projected into a multivariate real space, on which we can use all available standard multivariate methods.\nThe objectives of this course are to let the students understand the mathematical principles behind compositions, and asses the quality of genomic data. The students will learn how to perform explorative data analysis and visualize compositions, and finally how to use standard statistical methods in a compositional framework.\nApart from the study of genomics, compositional data are encountered in broad range of study fields (e.g., geology, chemistry, political sciences, environmental studies, health science, etc.) and this course is therefore relevant for any student who has an interest in general data science.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nBiological oceanography deals with the life in the oceans – the interactions between organisms and their physical and chemical environment. We will focus on the structure and function of marine food webs, and strive to understand how biological processes control the species interactions and their responses to environmental forcing, and how global patterns emerge from these individual interactions. The course offers a mechanistic understanding of the most important biological processes in aquatic systems and their dependency on the environment. We will present the different trophic levels and illustrate different scales of the marine environment, starting at the individual level, and advancing to population, community and global scales of the marine ecosystem. The theoretical knowledge will be compared to the observations on the development of spring bloom obtained by shore-based sampling, and used in an assignment to evaluate the environmental impact of hypothetical off-shore construction projects. The course will enable the students to appreciate cause-consequence relationships and assess the effects of environmental changes to marine ecosystems and the global ocean.\nThe course addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 ‘Life below water’, particularly its targets to prevent and reduce marine pollution (14.1) and to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems (14.2).",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the main factors influencing productivity and species interactions at different trophic levels of the marine ecosystem.\nDescribe how individual interactions shape the population and ecosystem level processes and how environmental forcing and anthropogenic stressors influence marine systems at both ecosystem and global scales.\nDemonstrate by simple calculations some basic concepts of biological oceanography such as the dependency of phytoplankton cell size on nutrient concentrations or zooplankton ingestion rate on food concentration.\nConstruct simple conceptual food-web and population models within marine environments and explain how they differ from trait-based approaches.\nDevelop and conduct a seasonal sampling campaign to investigate the development of the phytoplankton spring bloom and interpret the results in connection to literature and model calculations.\nAnalyse and present selected research within biological oceanography based on a recent research article.\nApply the knowledge of ocean biology to assess the environmental sustainability of diverse off-shore or coastal construction projects.\nPresent the results of an environmental impact assessment for a hypothetical project dealing with the marine environment orally and in writing.",

The course lectures will initially cover key concepts and paradigms in fisheries oceanography and then be followed by lectures on larval feeding ecology and predation processes (e.g., fish, jellyfish) before progressing to the oceanographic impacts on higher levels of biological organisation (i.e., biodiversity, biogeography, foodweb interactions involving fish). The course will span concepts from individual to population and community scales, and from small to large temporal – spatial scales. Students will learn how knowledge of specific processes can be applied to advise on how to conserve and manage fish populations and marine ecosystems.

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nFisheries management has global problems because the combined ecological, economic and sociological interactions and consequences of the fishery and the management are not considered. The scientific management advice is at present mainly based on evaluation of single stocks. Eg. the overall biological and economic consequences of data poor non-assessed stocks and mixed fisheries, i.e. where several stocks of both target and unintended bycatch species are exploited in the same fishery, are not fully integrated into management. The effects of technological development and economic incentives and behavioral changes in the fishery are not taken into consideration, which impact the development of both stocks, fisheries, and the ecosystem. Also, the ecological interactions are not integrated into the management advice. Newly developed stock, fisheries and ecosystem based management models cover this complexity. This enables a more flexible and integrated scientific evaluation and advice with respect to development in stocks and fisheries and considers impacts from environment, fisheries, and management start conditions under different management systems. The course will make students familiar with selected quantitative stock based, ecosystem based and bio-economic fisheries based management methods and evaluation models, which forms the basis for fisheries management advice and management strategy evaluation. The course gives students a basic understanding of the structure, dynamics, and function of the different management and fisheries systems from an ecological and socioeconomic perspective. It will provide tools to evaluate key stock, fisheries and ecological data, parameters, and indicators and to evaluate management scenarios before implementation with respect to their biological, bio-economic (fleet) and sociological (behavior) impacts, sustainability, and risks (uncertainty/ sensitivity) – like a flight simulator.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the development in fisheries and ecosystem based management systems (and associated advice) globally and in EU, as well as their conceptual methods, models and institutional set-up.\nDescribe the complexity in fisheries management, decision making processes, and management options in context of multiple objectives and risks with respect to management of the sea.\nDescribe and discuss management evaluation models which integrate the dynamics of the living resources in dependence of the fishing activity, environmental forcing, and the biological species inter-actions.\nApply and use different versions of advanced stock based (1), fisheries based (2) and ecosystem based (3) marine management models incl. stock, bio-economic and broader ecosystem based management evaluation tools.\nEstimate and evaluate fisheries impact on stocks and the marine ecosystem under different conditions and scenarios using the models and different estimation methods.\nEstimate and evaluate how climatic factors impact on stock production, size, and distribution, and the resulting fishing opportunities for different fleets using these models and methods.\nDescribe the efficiency and precision of the models in relation to integrated evaluation of stock and fleet dynamics and with respect to different advisory and management scenarios.\nDiscuss integrated ecosystem based management covering several stocks and fishing fleets as well as their mutual interactions and the interactions with environmental forcing factors.\nDescribe homogeneous fisheries and calculate fleet specific fishing mortality under consideration of fleet specific fishing efficiency, behavior, and selectivity towards target and by-catch species.\nEvaluate bio-economic effects of management scenarios, options and strategies under different management systems before implementation in context of environmental variability.",
        "Content": "The course will be based on an overview and educate students in the developments in fisheries and ecosystem based management systems globally and in EU, as well as their conceptual methods, models and institutional set-up. The course will give understanding of the complexity in fisheries management, decision making processes, and management options in context of multiple objectives and risks with respect to management of the sea. On this basis the course will give practical experience in use of different versions of advanced fisheries based and ecosystem based marine management evaluation models, as well as global understanding of the complexity in fisheries management systems. There will be made a general introduction to fisheries policies and their implementation, governance and institutional set-up. This is followed by an introduction to R in context of models used in the course and methods for basic fisheries data modelling. Simple and advanced methods and models will be used to assess fish stocks and fisheries, the side-effects of fisheries, as well as to make fisheries management strategy evaluation (MSE) and forecasts. The course will provide the student with basic quantitative and qualitative tools to estimate and evaluate fisheries impact on stocks and the marine ecosystem under different pre-conditions by use of the models both in data rich and data poor conditions. This includes estimation of stock specific abundances and fishing mortalities as well as fisheries reference points associated with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) from time series of catch and survey data using surplus production (SPiCT) and age-based (SAM) models. Also, the students will be educated in stakeholder perception of fisheries management and MSE. In general, the course will give the student tools to evaluate stock based, ecological and fisheries bio-economic effects of different types of and scenarios for management, i.e. management options, strategies and management systems, before implementation under consideration of other ecosystem impacts. This also includes evaluation and understanding of economic and sociological consequences for different stakeholders and actors. Finally, the course provides methods to evaluate and discuss ecosystem based management covering single and several stocks and fishing fleets in a cross disciplinary and cross sector perspective where the interactions between those are considered as well as the interactions with environmental and climate forcing factors.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to provide students with theoretical and practical knowledge about how modern DNA based methods can be used in management of fisheries resources and biodiversity conservation in aquatic environments. Through seminars and laboratory exercises students will learn how genetic methods are used to identify fish species and to partition fish into genetically separated populations (stocks), and how this knowledge can be applied as a tool in fisheries management, such as for defining management units and for enforcement of fisheries regulations. Students are expected to understand and analyse how human activities such as fishing, habitat alteration and climate change can affect biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems and how genetic composition and human evolutionary impact affect the survival and productivity of fish populations. Finally, the students are expected to be able to analyse the consequences of different management strategies on the genetic diversity on all levels of biological organisation from individual over population to species and be able to predict consequences of individual management strategies for survival and productivity of wild fish populations in marine and freshwater environments.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDemonstrate knowledge on DNA based genetic analyses and understanding of their application to practical fisheries management and aquatic biodiversity conservation.\nConduct practical laboratory DNA analysis including: DNA extraction, PCR analysis and genotyping of DNA markers using state of the art equiptment.\nDemonstrate knowledge of fundamental population genetic terms such as the population concept, migration, genetically effective population size, selection and local adaptation.\nDemonstrate knowledge of central concepts in conservation biology such as minimum effective population sizes, optimal design of reserves and protected areas.\nAnalyse population genetic data using statistical methods of relevance to fisheries science, fisheries management and conservation biology.\nDemonstrate insights into the newest developments within genomic research and evaluate how these methods can be applied for analysis of genetic adaptations to the local environment, so-called local adaptations, and environmentally induced stress.\nAnalyse the consequences of habitat alterations, exploitation and climate change on the genetic composition and evolution of fish populations.\nEvaluate genetic, evolutionary and demographic consequences of different management strategies for wild fish populations, as well as potential adverse effects on ecosystem biodiversity.",
        "Content": "The course is based on a number of cases and practical laboratory exercises, illustrating how DNA based methods are applied in analysis of fish populations and for generating information of importance for defining management areas, estimation of population size, identification of Illegal, Uncontrolled and Unreported fishing, conservation of genetic resources, as well as “genetic monitoring” of the impact of human activities such as fishing, supplementation and global change. The course will review basic concepts in relation to how genetic variation is distributed within and among populations, “population genetic” parameters, such as mutation, migration, random genetic drift and selection. This includes a discussion of the population concept, effective population size, neutral genes and genes subject to selection, as well as adaptation to local environment. The subjects will be integrated with central general concepts in conservation biology, such as minimum effective population size for avoiding inbreeding and loss of genetic variation, as well as design of protected areas for conservation of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential. Recent developments in genetic and genomic research will be addressed. This line of research has provided a wealth of new opportunities in fisheries genetics, for example by identifying genes of important ecological function and fish species from environmental samples (e-DNA) and processed fish products. The different topics will be integrated through evaluation of how human induced environmental alterations like climate change and fisheries induced evolution are expected to affect future adaptation, distribution and abundance of fish populations. Effects of different management and conservation tools, i.e. marine protected areas, supplementation and fisheries regulations, will be evaluated in relation to mitigating potential negative genetic effects. Students select their own case study, which serve as the basis for an assignment.",

        "Content": "The course covers fundamental concepts in fish nutrition and bioenergetics in aquaculture. We begin with the anatomy and morphology of the digestive system, and the information on dietary preferences that can be inferred. The course covers the macronutrients, examining the different amino acids and fatty acids, essential and non-essential nutrients, and their roles in fish nutrition. Nutritional requirements and essential nutrients are covered from a feed manufacture perspective, including considerations in the selection of raw materials, and the possibilities and limitations for substitution with alternative ingredients. We will examine feed intake, appetite, and digestive processes in fish, in addition to their energy use, and the substrates that are used to provide energy to the fish. Students will formulate a theoretical experimental diet for a species of their choice and benchmark its performance using established assessment methods. The diet will be used in a model for production of fish in aquaculture.",

        "Content": "The course is an introduction to mathematical modelling of population dynamics of living organisms, from bacteria to whales. Focus is on conceptual models based on differential and difference equations that illustrate basic concepts in population modelling. An important goal is to develop the ability to connect a biological context to an abstract mathematical model, i.e., to develop an understanding of the biological assumptions underlying the model and the ecological consequences of its results. The main topics are single-species population models (logistic growth), multi-species models (competition and predator-prey relations), functional responses, exploitation of living systems, seasonal succession, epidemiological models, and spatial population dynamics. Further basic concepts from evolutionary dynamics are introduced. Half of the sessions are used to train basic model programming based on examples of biological systems. Some emphasis is on the development and evaluation of the presentation skills of the students. In the last part of the course, the students develop their own projects, which are evaluated in a poster session.",

        "Content": "Content\nThe course will introduce students to continuum physics and derive the Navier Stokes equations from Newtons laws of motion and 2 theorems of vector calculus. The governing equations for geophysical fluid dynamics follows from these with the incorporation of the Coriolis effect. A series of assumptions and restrictions lead to the shallow water equations which form the basis of the dynamical descriptions covered in the course. Specifically, wave-like solutions to these equations will be examined (Kelvin waves, Rossby waves, Internal gravity waves). Students are introduced to the concept turbulence closure and how this provides a tractable means of incorporating internal fluid friction into these dynamics. Particular attention is given to wind driven dynamics (Ekman transport and Ekman pumping) and how these lead to various descriptions of global wind driven circulation (Sverdup balance, Stommel model, Munk model).\nThroughout, the theoretical basis of geophysical fluid dynamics will be illustrated with observations such as sea surface height anomalies from satellites, drift track of argo floats, and mooring timeseries.\nLearning sessions are organized as lectures, group exercises and student feedback that are constructively aligned. Class activities involve:\n• Lectures covering specific topics, and to prepare students for in class exercises and\ngroup work.\n• Problem solving (e.g. filling in some of the mathematical arguments to complete equation derivations).\n• Small research exercises to find, analyze and visualize available observations illustrating dynamical processes covered theoretically.\n• Plenary presentation and discussion to provide feedback on exercises from both peers and teacher.\nStudents will also conduct a group project in which they will develop a numerical solution on a global scale to the problem of wind driven surface circulation.

The second is to provide experience of a realistic working scenario for the production of evidence based advice, and exposure to the producers and recipients of such advice in an aquatic resource management context. This course aims to provide concrete skills and knowledge that are often learned on the job, in an impromptu manner.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDetermine the range of ecosystem services that a given case-study habitat/resource provide.\nIdentify possible management tools that could be employed to protect a case-study habitat/resource.\nDiscuss the policies that enable implementation of the identified management tools and where there are cases of potential alignment or conflict.\nEvaluate management strategies for the protection of single ecosystem components within a case-study.\nAppraise proposed management strategies for a range of ecosystem components in a given case-study habitat/resource.\nRecommend a management strategy for a given habitat/resource. Justify the selected actions by describing the trade-offs and interactions between different ecosystem components.\nConduct a systematic literature review and synthesise findings.\nProduce and present communicative posters targeting a scientific audience.\nProduce and evaluate written recommendations for managers and policy makers based on best available knowledge as summarised and presented by peers.\nEvaluate and provide constructive feedback on peer’s scientific posters and advisory reports.",
        "Content": "The management of aquatic resources is shifting away from a focus on single system components (such as fisheries or water quality) and towards more holistic forms of management; (i.e. Ecosystem Approach to Management). While there are varying degrees of complexity under this umbrella term (e.g. EBFM or ICZM), they all share a requirement for the synthesis of existing knowledge across disparate disciplines.\nThere are many actors and stakeholders, (e.g. ministries, construction consultancies, environmental NGOs, fisheries organisations, wind energy companies, local governments), with traditionally narrow focuses, who require people with the ability to collate, digest and synthesise knowledge from outside their traditional realm of experience, to provide advice with a broad, systemic view. This course provides an opportunity to learn appropriate tools and skills for these tasks, as well as an opportunity to gain experience in the collaborative nature of producing advice, all while facilitating interaction with potential future employers. Topics covered in this course include (1) ecosystem services and trade-offs, (2) how to undertake systematic reviews, (3) what is stakeholder engagement, (4) the relevance of legislation in advice, (5) science communication, (6) from policy to management action and (7) the synthesis of knowledge in support of advice.\nThe course is structured around a topical, multi-stakeholder management problem in the realm of aquatic resources (e.g. the extraction of sediment from the Øresund for construction). This problem is identified by the course responsible, in collaboration with representatives from industry / public sector, each year. In the first class, this pre-identified problem is analysed as a class and dissected into smaller components (e.g. fish production, water quality, coastal erosion, marine mammal conservation). Working in pairs or independently, students utilise their diversity of backgrounds and personal knowledge to address one sub-component per pair, by undertaking a systematic review during a series of class-time workshops and as home assignments. The results of this review are presented in a poster session, held halfway through the course, where stakeholders who were involved in deciding the problem are invited to attend. Posters will be graded by teachers and peer-grading during the poster session. Subsequently, the collection of results and posters from the whole class form the foundation of knowledge from which individuals write an advisory report on the broader, multi-sectorial problem as the final assessment. During this second half of the course, lectures and guest lectures will inspire management solutions and how to best produce evidence",

        "Content": "Fisheries support many millions of livelihoods, provide food security, and contribute to national economies as well as coastal societies, but fisheries can also impact ecosystems negatively. For instance, fishing activities may disrupt food webs, damage the sea floor, or be responsible for the unintended captures of threatened marine animals. During the past decades, important effort has been made to develop the science and fisheries policies. In this course, we will study how fisheries scientists assess the size of fish stocks to produce stock-by-stock catch advice and how ecosystem considerations currently is moving up on the fisheries management agenda. We will look at concrete examples of fisheries management measures, including quota limits, time/area closures and actual Marine Protected Areas (MPA). The lectures will have a global perspective but will focus more closely on the North-East Atlantic and EU waters. The R programming language, being one of the most often used in ecology and fisheries science, will be used for the analytical parts of the course. The course program consists of (1) four modules covering the global perspective on fisheries, stock-by-stock assessments, and the ICES advice system, (2) four modules with analytical exercises in R, (3) four modules on the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, including a short legislative background and the tools available to managers to ensure fisheries sustainability and biodiversity conservation, and (4) a report assignment with a predefined problem that needs a solution.

        "Content": "Untreated aquaculture effluent can contain excess nutrients, organic matter, and other pollutants that can negatively affect water quality and harm aquatic ecosystems. Nutrient-rich effluent can lead to eutrophication causing algae blooms, oxygen depletion, and habitat degradation, harming fish and other aquatic life. Many countries have regulations and standards in place to control the discharge of pollutants from aquaculture operations. The European Union (EU) has established regulations and directives governing various aspects of aquaculture, including the management of aquaculture effluents to protect water quality and ecosystems as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) aiming at achieving good water status for all surface waters (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) and groundwater within the EU. Aquaculture activities are required to comply with local and national measures to minimize their impact on water quality, such as Strategic Guidelines for the Sustainable Development of European Aquaculture, Blue Growth Strategy, Strategic Action Plan for European Aquaculture, Farm to Fork Strategy and the European Green deal.\n\"End-of-pipe treatment\" in aquaculture refers to the practice of treating waste or effluent generated by fish farms or aquaculture facilities before it is released into natural water bodies such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. It helps aquaculture facilities in complying with environmental regulations and avoiding fines or legal penalties. Treatment of effluent is a key component of sustainable aquaculture practices, minimizing environmental footprint and reducing negative impacts on surrounding ecosystems. The concept of the circular economy in aquaculture effluent management involves minimizing waste, maximizing resource efficiency, and promoting the reuse and recycling of by-products and nutrients within the aquaculture production as; residual resource valorization, nutrient recovery, energy production, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems, aquaponics, and land-based seaweed.\nEngineering solutions for aquaculture end-of-pipe treatment are crucial in the sustainable development and efficient operation of aquaculture systems. These solutions require knowledge on; system design and planning, system evaluation and mass balances, water quality management and processes, environmental impact assessment and mitigation, optimization of system performance and holistic concepts for minimizing environmental impacts while reducing operational costs and increasing profitability.",

        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine recreational fishing including a description of different angling types/techniques.\nExplain different management strategies for recreational fishery, e.g. adaptive management.\nDescribe and explain strengths and weaknesses of habitat restoration and fish stocking as management tools in recreational fisheries.\nDescribe, compare, and explain the purpose and effects of different fishery control initiatives used to regulate harvest of target fish populations e.g. slot length, quota, minimum size limits, closed seasons, closed areas and critically review their efficiency.\nPresent and discuss pros and cons of catch-and-release fishing (C&R) as a management tool and give specific guidelines to how mortality and sub-lethal effects in C&R fishing can be minimized (i.e., best practice).\nDescribe, explain, and give examples of values and impacts of recreational fishing in terms of economics and human dimension aspects.\nDescribe traditional and novel survey methods used to investigate different aspects of recreational fishing (e.g., fisheries metrics, biological information, human dimensions), explain their strengths and weaknesses, and provide survey design for specific fisheries.\nExplain angler heterogeneity using the recreation specialization framework, how it is measured and how it translates into angler behavior and the implications for management e.g., in terms of fishing trip motivation, consumption orientation and attitudes towards conservation and regulations.\nGive examples of different direct and indirect biological impacts of recreational fisheries on aquatic ecosystems.\nProduce management solutions to specific recreational fisheries management problems and explain the biological, socio economical and/or conservation arguments behind the advice.",
        "Content": "Recreational fishing is a billion euro business which directly and indirectly impacts the ecology of aquatic ecosystems, e.g. through effects on the environment, food webs or on specific populations, as well as various human dimensions, e.g., in terms of social and economic processes and consequences. Moreover, when managing recreational fisheries it seems just as important to understand angler behavior as it is to understand population dynamics and behaviour of fish. Therefore, the interdisciplinary interaction between social and natural science holds the future for successful recreational fisheries management. The course will introduce adaptive management and the three tools in traditional recreational fishery management; fish stocking, habitat restoration and fishery regulation, with special focus on the latter (e.g. catch and release fishing, bag limits, closed seasons etc.) In addition, human dimensions, such as angler typology, behavior and demography, ethical costs, and socio-economic benefits to the community from angling will be addressed. Finally, a part of the course will be dedicated to introducing the methodologies that typically are used when investigating biological impacts and the human dimensions in recreational fishing.\nThe course will be a mixture of lectures, exercises, and self-study, all aligned with the learning objectives. In addition, the students will have to prepare written assignments, containing elements given by the teacher and others chosen by the student.",

However, during the course, complexity will gradually increase as we will see how these processes occur in complex multicellular eukaryotes, and how their actions are coordinated via global regulatory networks, for example by signal transduction pathways. In the end, this knowledge will allow us to discuss topics like developmental biology and the molecular biology of cancer. Two recurrent motifs will be highlighted throughout the course: understanding the interconnectedness of physiological processes within the cell, and devising strategies to intervene in these complex processes, either to manipulate a production/model-organism or to develop a cure for a human disease.",

In the course, students work in small teams, each aiming at developing their own strain or set of strains. The typical task is to delete or insert specific genes in order to make strains that allow a specific biological question to be addressed. The individual projects therefore constitute a miniature research project. Hence, based on a specific scientific question new strains will be constructed. Subsequent characterization of the strains will then address the initial question asked. The projects will typically involve baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or a filamentous fungus like Aspergillus niger. The genetic modifications will be implemented by using a state of the art genetic tool box containing “bio blocks” like promoters, reporter genes, terminators, The course will finish with small presentations, where student teams present their biological question, the experimental strategy, as well as their results in a session including the entire class.

LOCs deal with the handling of extremely small fluid volumes (microfluidics) down to sub-nano liters, and have channel dimensions in the regime from 1 millimeter to 100 nanometers.\n\nThe general goal of the course is that you will be able to analyze, and model the mode of operation of some chosen lab-on-a-chip systems with the help of simple calculations based on basic microfluidic theory. Moreover, it is the goal that you will be able to numerically model and design new lab-on-a-chip systems using COMSOL Multiphysics. The course is therefore relevant for you that would like to learn how to use COMSOLs many possibilities for modelling microfluidic systems with focus on mainly biology relevant applications.",

The course is not a theoretical microfluidics course, but basic theory of microfluidics, diffusion, AC electrokinetics and AC physics will be presented, so that you will be able to understand and validate the numerical results. The theoretical focus is therefore on important dimensionless numbers, simple calculations of expected flow velocities and diffusion times, order of magnitude calculations of forces etc. Most theoretical exercises are coupled with similar numerical exercises, so that you can compare your simple calculations with COMSOL’s results. You can expect to learn how to use COMSOL, with many practical exercises and “how-to” troubleshooting.",

This will enable the students to evaluate and assess complex aspects of sustainability in connection to production of bioenergy and associated technical challenges – including handling and characterization of biomass resources, stepwise thermal conversion and utilization of resulting biochar as soil-improving product in future farming systems and as a mean for CCS - carbon capture and storage.\nThe students will also be presented with the current research activities in the research group and be introduced to the main challenges associated with pyrolysis, gasification and sustainability aspects of biomass today.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAssess the potential and sustainability of selected biomass resources\nClarify the principles of pyrolysis and gasification processes and the most important technical challenges\nPerform mass and energy balances for pyrolysis and gasification processes\nUnderstand the effect of the most important fuel properties and their effect on the gasification and pyrolysis process\nCarry out simple thermal conversion processes\nCharacterize products of biomass pyrolysis and gasification, including biochar, producer gas, bio-oil and its potential as biofuel\nDescribe the potential applications for the products of pyrolysis and gasification, and their role in a circular bioeconomy\nPresent and discuss results obtained in experimental exercises",
        "Content": "The course will be structured in three main parts:\n− Biomass resources sustainability and characterization\n− Theory and practice of pyrolysis and gasification\n− Analysis of products and reporting of results\n\nThe biomass resource and characterization part focuses on biomass as a renewable energy source and its different conversion paths for energy applications. Moreover, challenges that occur during thermal biomass conversion will be discussed.\n\nThe theory behind gasification and pyrolysis processes will be covered in the lectures, as well as an overview on the state-of-the art technologies. Experimental runs of pyrolysis and gasification reactors at Risø will provide a practical example of such processes. Simple calculations of mass balance and energy balances for selected processes will be carried out.\n\nThe products, such as biochar, bio-oil and gas and their characterization methods will be introduced and the students will apply these in the experimental work in the laboratory, including elemental analysis, GC and GC-MS analysis, Karl-Fisher titration, BET analysis.\n\nEnough time will be given during the course to work on the report of lab experiments results. In addition, students will have to complete a final exam focused on the contents of the course lectures, especially technology fundamentals and applications of pyrolysis and gasification technologies and products.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTypical chemical plants may contain hundreds of measurements and control loops. Most control theories (those you have seen in the introduction to process control) assume that a control structure is already given at the start, which reduces the problem to tuning and calculation of a control law. In practice, however, given a plant design with its process flow diagram, a control engineer faces the following problems: i) which variables should be controlled, ii) which variables should be measured, iii) which inputs should be manipulated, and iv) which links should be established between them? These are the questions that the plantwide control course addresses. To this end, a systematic methodology based on hierarchical decomposition of the control problem into layers is used for designing a plantwide control structure based on process understanding. The performance of the control structure is then evaluated and further refined using dynamic simulations of the process in question in an iterative manner.\n\nThe goal of the course is thus to learn i) to manage the complicated task of designing a control strategy for the entire plant; ii) to understand process dynamics using dynamic simulations; iii) to develop and implement a control strategy that meets control design objectives (stabilize the system, optimize the economics, environmental sustainability and satisfy the constraints); and vi) evaluation of alternative solutions. Ultimately all these efforts are to help develop and operate better, safer, and optimal processes for chemical and biochemical industries.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPerform a systematic analysis of the operation of chemical and biochemical process plants\nDerive a control structure based upon the process analysis\nCalculate the optimal point of operation for the control system\nDerive simple linear models for control design from complex process systems\nAnalyse observability and controlability of a dynamical system\nDesign multivariable PID control structures\nFormulate and design model based multivariable controllers, incl. LQR, LQG and MPC\nEvaluate controller's performance using simulation and dynamic process model",
        "Content": "The course base is the synthesis of the plant and its derived operational goals which illustrate that process design and operation are two sides of the same fundamental problem. Selection of actuators and measurements for a basic control structure at the single variable layer is introduced from a systematic model analysis. In a subsequent synthesis step a pairing of actuators and measurements is selected. How the operational goals may be achieved in practice through control is illustrated for selected examples. These examples will also demonstrate characteristic control structures.",
        "Remarks": "The project includes derivation of a plantwide control strategy using a systematic approach and its evaluation using dynamic simulations. The plant in question is a typical processing unit in the kemical industry. A project report is prepared critically discussing and evaluating the performance of the plant wide control strategy.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTypical chemical plants may contain hundreds of measurements and control loops. Most control theories (those you have seen in the introduction to process control) assume that a control structure is already given at the start, which reduces the problem to tuning and calculation of a control law. In practice, however, given a plant design with its process flow diagram, a control engineer faces the following problems: i) which variables should be controlled, ii) which variables should be measured, iii) which inputs should be manipulated, and iv) which links should be established between them? These are the questions that the plantwide control course addresses. To this end, a systematic methodology based on hierarchical decomposition of the control problem into layers is used for designing a plantwide control structure based on process understanding and with an economic production objective in mind. The performance of the control structure is then evaluated and further refined using dynamic simulations of the process in question in an iterative manner.\n\nThe goal of the course is thus to learn i) how data acquisition and controls are managed in an industrial setting; ii) to manage the complicated task of designing a control strategy for the entire plant or a multivariable process; iii) to understand process dynamics using dynamic simulations and process data; vi) to develop and implement a control strategy that meets control design objectives (stabilize the system, optimize the economics, environmental sustainability and satisfy the constraints); and v) evaluation of alternative solutions. Ultimately all these efforts are to help develop and operate better, safer, and optimal processes for chemical and biochemical industries.",

        "Content": "This course will start with a fast recap of development and design of single loop control using feedforward and feedback with PID control. Special emphasis will be given to controller tuning and troubleshooting of poor performance before delving into control systems instrumentation, Distributed Control System (DSC) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, data communication protocols and process historians.\n\nFollowing this, the course will introduce the plantwide challenges for control systems and discuss different approached for process optimization in both continuous and batch manufacturing systems and the implications for this type of production planning at the control and operation level.\n\nIn the last part of the course method for multivariable and model-based control are introduced and special focus is given to control of bioreactors in batch and fed-batch operation.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe principal objective of this course is to expose the necessary mathematical and computational methods to bridge the gap between optics and image processing, and perform image analysis and acquisition in the context of computer vision and computational imaging. The course will cover applications e.g. in optics, hyperspectral imaging, imaging spectroscopy, medical imaging, computational imaging, or computer vision and pattern recognition. The course is split between theory, exercises and projects, allowing the students to get hands on experience on the taught methods.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply the concepts of Harmonic analysis and Compressed Sensing to imaging\nDesign computer vision and computational imaging systems and algorithms\nAnalyze and process signals from cameras and optical sensors\nApply the concepts of inverse problems and linear optimization to imaging\nRecover, analyze and process spectrally resolved data from optical sensors or images\nRecover and analyze scene physics from optical sensors or digital images\nApply Deep Learning and Machine Learning frameworks to solve computational imaging problems\nProcess and analyze hyperspectral images with Machine Learning methods",
        "Content": "The course presents a wide range of computational methods, classic and novel, used for analysis of digital images. It covers for instance recovering data or physical information from sparse or dense measurements, reconstructing and restoring images, performing automated image analysis such as facial recognition or AI aided medical diagnosis, and designing advanced imaging systems with applications in e.g. spectroscopy.\n\nThe course consists of five parts:\n1. Introduction to digital imaging\n2. Sparse representations and image restoration\n3. Scene analysis and spectral imaging\n4. Introduction to deep learning for computational imaging\n5. Computational spectroscopy and hyperspectral image analysis\n\nThe course focuses first on traditional digital imaging: after presenting the fundamentals of colorimetry, the functional principles of sensing devices used for image acquisition and classic image processing tools, such as kernel filtering, are covered. Then advanced harmonic analysis methods will be introduced to exploit the sparse nature of digital images, with applications in image restoration, time and frequency analysis, and compression. This will be followed by an overview of state of the art image restoration methods, including sparse optimization methods, numerical methods for image inpainting and classic filter based approaches for denoising. Spectral imaging and scene physics analysis will then be presented with the motivation to retrieve scene physics and spectral information from digital imaging. Afterwards, deep learning methods will be introduced as an overview of concepts and architectures for application to image analysis. Finally, we will address the applications of deep learning and sparse optimization to imaging spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging analysis, with a focus in medical imaging.",

        "Content": "The course deals with novel control methods and concepts in the area of robust and optimal control, fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control.\n\nRobust and optimal control are applied where the controller needs to be independent of variations in the control object, i.e. the effect from the variations on the performance is minimal. Fault diagnosis is applied for detection and/or isolating faults in dynamical systems. Faults can e.g. be a sensor break down, a valve is not working optimal, etc. Fault diagnosis is applied for supervision of dynamical systems in connection with fault-tolerant control. When major changes happen in the control object or in the controller due to e.g. faults in the system, it can be necessary to make changes in the controller/control architecture to avoid undesired stop of production, break down or safety hazards. This can be done in a systematic way by using fault-tolerant control, where the control system is reconfigured or the control object is closed down in a safe way.\n\nThe first part of the course includes an introduction to the other parts of the course.\n\nBoth analysis and design methods will be presented, the participants will work actively with analysis and design and real application cases are used to illustrate the concepts. Participants will work with the latest generation of dedicated software for the analysis and design of fault-tolerant and robust control systems.\n\nA number of small exercises/examples will be applied together with two larger assignments with associated test setup in the laboratory.",

The course will be conducted following this general modelling framework, by firstly introducing the features of the complex engineered systems and the challenges in their daily operation. The students shall learn to analyze the design and control of these systems and specify the operation goals and functions. The course will then introduce the theory and method of functional modelling and its application (implementation of knowledge systems) to support complex plant operation.

This will be achieved by studying e.g. students’ competency development, understanding team dynamics, planning project work, and handling conflicts in multi-disciplinary within a team. Furthermore, there is emphasis on internal and external (verbal, visual and written) communication. The students will reflect how the different tools and techniques are relevant, and can be used to improve their personal, entrepreneurial and education life (based on literature or personal experience).

In lectures, exercises and group work the students gradually learn how to perform feasibility studies. Throughout the course, students work on two real-life cases, for which they elaborate a comprehensive feasibility report and present their work to external examiners. The business ideas can derive from students, companies, DTU technology or (societal) challenges. Within these two different projects, students will actively perform feasibility studies in different team constellations. The teams will look at the evidence of need and customer development, potential market size, technical feasibility and constraints, cost of development and the availability of funding to both initiate the project and to keep it going. As the projects centre around sustainable solutions, students will actively integrate sustainability indicators and ethical considerations that can provide supplementary information with regard to the opportunities and risks involved in a business idea.\nThe course shall prepare MSc Technology Entrepreneurship students to decide on a project and team to work on throughout the rest of their studies. It will also prepare them to navigate in a professional work environment that demands skills in both engineering and economics, e.g. as in business development or project management.\n\nMost of the work will happen outside the classroom and will be done in groups.

The relationship between the time- and frequency-domain expressions is stressed. Green's theorem is used to derive a number of useful relations between coefficients, as well as high- and low-frequency limits. Green's theorem also leads to the Boundary Integral form of the problem and further to the Boundary Element Method (BEM) which is the most widely used numerical solution technique for obtaining the hydrodynamic coefficients. A number of variants of the BEM are discussed including both 2D strip-type methods and 3D methods based on either the free-surface or the Rankine Green function. As exercises, the student will develop their own 2D, BEM solver is both for infinite fluid problems and for wave radiation and diffraction. Finite difference and finite volume solutions are also discussed. Weekly exercises are solved to illustrate the theory. A solver for the equations of motion is built in Matlab and applied to analyse several typical structures. Several short concept tests will also be given during the course of the Semester.",

        "Content": "The fundamental concepts of dynamics are introduced for simple systems with a single degree of freedom. Hereby, aspects such as natural frequencies, damping and resonance are introduced by determining the system’s free vibrations and its forced response to harmonic and transient loading.\n\nThe foundation of the dynamics of flexible structures is subsequently described by the theory for free beam vibrations, while the connection between this continuous element and its corresponding discrete structural model is illustrated by applying the finite element method to solve the partial differential equation. The dynamic analysis of discrete structures with multiple degrees of freedom is then conducted by modal analysis, based on a series representation by the vibration forms of the structure. Hereby, the influence of the load’s frequency content and its spatial distribution is considered, together with the potential of quasi-static system reduction techniques.\n\nFor flexible structures, the damping of the system is crucial for the magnitude of the dynamic response, why various naturally occurring damping mechanisms are scrutinized. Furthermore, the effect of external dampers on flexible structures is treated, including the use of tuned mass dampers. For flexible structures with local dampers or advanced loading, the dynamic equations are solved by direct time integration using the Newmark method.\n\nThe theoretical content of the course is illustrated by simple experiments and treated in exercises, which can be solved in Python.

In particular, the focus is on performance monitoring and decision support systems, used to, respectively, monitor fuel efficiency (retrospectively) and guide crew in decisions focused on safety on-board the ship (in real-time). The course deals with a variety of topics, including seakeeping, human factors affecting ship operations, EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index), full-scale measurements, stochastic waves, ocean wave energy spectra, motion transfer functions.",

The focus of the course is application of the commercial CFD package: STAR-CCM+ for practical problems in fluid mechanics.\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the numerical analysis of fluid motion, heat transfer and associated phenomena. It involves the formulation of the governing partial diffential equations describing the transport of mass, momentum and heat, and a discretiation of these equations using finite-difference, finite-volume or finite-element methods.\nFor engineering applications the finite volume discretization is often method of choice as it allows simulations of fluid flow in complex geometries with a minimum requirement of computer memory and execution time. The course will outline the steps required for the spatial and temporal discretization of the governing equations using finite-volumes and describe techniques for the solution of the discrete set of equations.\nThe participants may bring their own (STAR-CCM+) flow problem for the exercises in the 3rd week of the course.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nRobust Design is a paradigm that aims to improve the quality and reliability of a design. Products are exerted to geometrical variation stemming from production tolerances, temperature changes, load conditions, etc. If design is robust, it means that the variance will not have a large impact on functionality or the quality of the product. However, if the design is not robust (sensitive) it could lead to the product not functioning, the product not being able to be assembled, high rejection rates during production, reduced quality for the user, product failures and in some cases product recalls and even fatalities. The typical strategy to deal with variance has been to tighten production tolerances to reduce variance, however this comes at great cost in terms of time, money and resources. By using the robust design methodology you will learn how to reduce the sensitivity of your designs and to not pass on difficult and costly tolerances and process requirements to the production team.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the potential of product robustness and its relationship to variation in the life cycle of mechanical products (with respect to function, reliability, production costs, etc.).\nExplain the challenges of turning a product idea to a functional and producible product (with respect to design of layout, interfaces, geometries, etc.).\nApply design principles and methods to reduce the complexity and sensitivity of mechanisms and products, hence to increase their robustness.\nApply quantitative methods and software tools for the specification of tolerances, the calculation of process capabilities, the prediction of failure rates, etc.\nUse the taught methods for an analysis of real-life cases from engineering practice and evaluate their applicability.\nReflect on the taught methods as part of an overall design process.\nSelect and apply the most appropriate methods for conducting a full Robust Design analysis (including the documentation and presentation of results in form of short reports).\nReview and evaluate one’s own Robust Design analysis and give feedback on the results of others.",
        "Content": "The course introduces the participants to the field of Robust Design (RD) by providing a basic RD toolbox that allows for an analysis of variation effects already in product development and for the design of robust products. Based on an introduction to basic RD theory and strategies, the course covers an overview of design approaches (Module 1: Mobility equations / Variation Reduction principles / Axiomatic Design / Kinematic principles for systems and interfaces / etc.) as well as an introduction to tolerance analysis and Engineering statistics (Module 2: Statistical tolerancing / Sensitivity studies / Process Capability indices / etc.). Each of the modules is complemented by a hands-on workshop session where the participants are provided with a physical case example to try out and test the methods they have been introduced to. Furthermore, the course usually features 1-2 guest talks from industry delegates to illustrate the relevance of RD for both large as well as small and medium sized companies.",

The concepts are based in traditional in requirements engineering but they extended so that they can used in meta disciplinary analysis of the selected building system. This stage intorduces the design science research methodology (DSRM) so that students define their solution objectives, based on then problem identification in the previous stage.\n\n(3) #DISCOVER GENES: Focus on the modelling of the agile Prototype using biodigital prototyping methods. Reverse engineer the features (genes) and pseudo developmental stages of the agile prototype (building system or product). Overarching concept for this assignment is the future concept of Pastcasting with the purpose of revealing biases.

Model-based machine learning corresponds to a class of algorithms, called Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), that allow the combination of domain knowledge with data-driven methods, in a very simple way.\n\nWhile Machine Learning has plenty of algorithms (e.g. Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, etc.) that have the benefit of being “push-button” solutions, they are generally very hardly adaptable beyond the original design. Our task becomes about transforming our problem and data to fit each individual algorithm. Many times, we drop relevant information (e.g. known relationship between 2 variables, different noise distributions in input variables), and our results may suffer from it.\n\nPGMs allow us to include prior knowledge, parametric and non-parametric (sub)-models, and uncertainty about inputs and parameters. They are perfect for combining different types of data, and, in the past few years, a growing community has developed tools for PGMs, that simplify its design and inference process. Together with Deep Learning, PGMs belong to the forefront of Machine Learning and Data Mining research, essential to process Big and Small Data.\n\nWhile this course is, in nature, about methodology, it is grounded on a sequence of example applications, mostly focused on transport system problems.",

Each project team will also be assigned a team facilitator (which are students who are taking the course 'Facilitating Innovation in Multidisciplinary Teams'). These facilitators have attained innovation competences and will guide the team during all project work.\n\nThe course is organized in two main parts.\nThe first week - the BOOST module - is focused on engaging the students with the topic of innovation, and introducing students to a systematic approach to innovation, including relevant theory. At the start of the first week, the students will be put into project groups on the basis of their chosen innovation challenge as well as their line of study et al.\nIn the second and third weeks - the EXPERIENCE module - the group's focus is on developing an innovation project in collaboration with their facilitator. This should result in a concept that must be presented to the stakeholders at the end of the process.\n\nThe course consists of lectures, reading material, group exercises, assignments, peer-reviews and multiple-choice quizzes.

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to give the participants a theoretical and practical basis for advanced decision support consisting of cost-benefit analysis, feasibility risk assessment, and strategic analysis using multi-criteria decision analysis.\nThe primary purpose will be to model and establish comprehensive decision support within a specific appraisal study context, emphasizing the strategic impacts and uncertainties involved. The modeling approach will apply cost-benefit analysis, feasibility risk assessment, and multi-criteria decision analysis when setting up and designing the decision support framework.",
        "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the economic foundations of a cost-benefit analysis\nAssess a project's intertemporal impacts through discounting and the social cost of carbon\nImplement and perform a cost-benefit analysis from a societal perspective on a large investment project\nImplement and perform a feasibility risk assessment using Monte Carlo simulation\nIdentify supplementing criteria to include in a strategic analysis from the perspective of decision-makers and stakeholders\nIdentify, organize, and assess accessible data material in the context of both a quantitative and a qualitative approach\nApply principles of multi-criteria decision analysis to assess the strategic impacts of a decision problem\nImplement and account for the methodology behind a composite analysis based on cost-benefit analysis, feasibility risk assessment, and multi-criteria decision analysis\nDesign and apply a comprehensive decision support model for a large investment problem\nCommunicate the chosen solution methods and performed analyses for a given problem area through a technical report",
        "Content": "The course treats basic and advanced theory and methodology in the assessment/appraisal/evaluation of major investment projects. An assessment of transport infrastructure projects forms the assignment of the course. However, the methods applied are universal and can be used for other types of projects as well. Knowledge about transport infrastructure projects is not a prerequisite to participating in the course.\n\nThe course's overall objective is to provide the best possible decision support by applying cost-benefit analysis (CBA), feasibility risk analysis, and strategic analysis using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and to combine them into a composite analysis for a pool of investment projects. The following topics will be treated in lectures and exercises, where it is assumed that the student holds some basic knowledge of economics:\n\nSocio-economic analysis: The theoretical foundations of the CBA, including social choice mechanisms, market (in)efficiency, social welfare, and the justification of public action. The students will become familiar with the theoretical elements of a CBA both in a static setting and in an intertemporal framework.\n\nRisk analysis and uncertainty: Theory and methodology concerning uncertainty and the concept of Optimism Bias. The topic is concerned with determining various uncertain elements in the CBA and treating these using reference class forecasting and Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nStrategic analysis: Theory and methodology concerning measuring non-quantifiable impacts, which often are strategic and hold the potential to improve the decision support. The students will get acquainted with different MCDA assessment techniques and how to combine these with the CBA and feasibility risk assessment results. The aim is to include several stakeholder perspectives in the final recommendations.\n\nThe course participants work in groups to apply and achieve practical knowledge about the analysis methods and concepts. It is expected that the students can clarify/account/argue for the chosen impacts/criteria and the model solutions in connection with the report work and the written examination.\n\nThe main course content consists of lectures and group exercises with plenary discussions.",

        "Content": "The content of this course is tailored to students who have average to no previous experience in programming and want to take other courses at DTU Wind. The course uses the Python programming language. During the course, students work in small groups on in-class exercises, weekly assignments, and two projects. Students must pass the first project to submit the second project. The final grade is evaluated based on the second project. Consistent practice in communication about scientific code is ensured by weekly group-to-group presentations of their solutions to the week’s assignment.\n\nIn the first part of the course, students learn how to collaborate in groups on code using the version-control software git/GitLab, which is used throughout the semester. After that, students use the foundational packages for scientific Python programming (numpy, matplotlib, scipy) to practice basic skills such as numeric array manipulation, loading/saving/visualizing data, and writing/importing functions. These skills are cemented in the first project, in which groups calculate the time-marching response of a simple wind turbine model to different turbulent wind conditions and visualize the resulting statistics.\n\nAfter the first project is handed in, more advanced topics are presented. This includes more abstract concepts from general programming—such as object-oriented practices, designing package architectures, and linting—as well as more wind-specific topics—e.g., packages and data formats that are commonly used in wind energy. The course ends with the final project, in which students work individually or in groups to publish a Python package for wind energy, complete with tests and documentation. A list of pre-defined final projects is provided, but students may submit a request for a different project if they have an idea they would like to pursue.",

        "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAt the core of the course is helping engineering students become more reflexive about their own role as engineers in broader society, be it when they design renewable energy technologies, and/or develop, operate and decommission renewable energy projects. Using wind energy as a primary case, but also covering the broader energy transition of the energy system (e.g. solar power, P2X, hybrid projects, energy communities), we equip students with selected social science methods and theories which they can use to investigate the broader implications of their engineering work. This will help them better understand the socio-technical controversies that technologies may provoke and provide them with knowledge of how to engage with these in a productive dialogue that can help dissolve barriers between ‘technical experts’ and ‘lay people’. A central concept is that the necessary engineering framing of a problem and its solution (what we call a “black box”) can have unintended consequences (or lead to more politicisation of the issue at hand). When understanding these consequences better, it becomes easier to engage and deal with the controversies over the technologies that engineers are designing, developing and deploying. The reason for these elements is that engineers of the future, especially those directly involved in the Green Transition, need to be able to co-create solutions that are socio-technically sustainable.",

The idea is to build a wind powered car to drive as fast as possible in direct headwind or to build the best performing wind turbine. The students are initially introduced to the competitions, the theory for and mechanics of the existing car/turbine. Assignments targeted at highlighting key fundamental physics and behavior of both the wind car and turbine are solved by the students. In parallel with course lectures, previously built wind cars/turbines are reviewed and based on new ideas / concepts, design and construction of a new or part of a new wind car/turbine is done. Identified core issues for the car/turbine structure are selected based on analysis of the aeromechanics and are solved in groups for each selected area (aerodynamics, wings, shroud, hub mechanics, transmission, control, instrumentation, electrical system, composite material, etc.). The disciplines related to design and construction are for example, aerodynamics, machinery elements, fiber composite, experimental testing, etc. The design tasks are adapted to the prior knowledge and ambition of the students. A key objective is the integration of the various components into a functional and effective wind car/turbine construction. Prior to the competitions the developed designs are tested in the field.",
        "Remarks": "The course is specifically aiming at designing and building for participating in international competitions on the fastest wind-turbine powered car or the best performing wind turbine. The first part of the course consists of a series of lectures and assignments aimed at familiarizing the students with the key physics and technical issues involved for both windcar and wind turbine. Armed with the knowledge and tools obtained in the first part, the students proceed to the last part of the course, where the student / group of students (3-5) identify a core issue for the vehicle's or turbine’s structure/design and thereafter plan and organize further activities to design, build, test and integrate the components.

Result verification in PowerFactory\nThis module introduces Python as a tool to automate calculations and processes in commercially available software, using PowerFactory as an example. In the final project, students utilize the built-in functionalities available in PowerFactory to control system parameters and execute software functions through the Python interface. Within this project, students conduct load flow analysis, security assessment, and fault calculation in PowerFactory, and compare the results of the commercial software with those obtained from the Python program developed in previous modules. Students are expected to identify and explain potential differences between the outcomes produced by the two programs.\n\nThe students will use Python for solving the hand-in assignments and therefore an introduction to Python will be arranged for the students at the beginning of the course.",

This course introduces the students to fundamental principles and algorithms of optimization theory, and shows them how to apply them to relevant decision-making problems in power systems.

The applications cover problems to be solved in a forward stage (e.g., in a day-ahead stage) or in real time. We then map those energy system applications into relevant machine learning methods. We first take the perspective of a stakeholder. The examples to be covered are (i) renewable energy trading in electricity markets in a forward stage, (ii) wind resource prediction in a forward stage via classical and value-oriented learning methods.\n2. We still continue from the perspective of a stakeholder. The examples to be covered is real-time control of an asset, e.g., a battery storage or an aggregator of distributed energy resources in continuous electricity markets.\n3. We take the perspective of a system operator. The examples to be covered are optimal day-ahead scheduling and risk assessment of the entire system.\nFor all three parts, we will provide relevant methods, implement them for a case study and analyze results.",

The quantitative information available from electron microscopy is essential for technology development in an enormous range of applications relevant to society including nanoparticles for e.g. catalysis, electrochemical technologies for energy harvesting/conversion/storage, materials for photonic and plasmonic devices, magnetic and quantum materials for computing applications and biomaterials.\n\nElectron microscopy in its various forms (SEM, TEM, STEM, Electron Diffraction), complemented by spectroscopic methods (EDS, EELS) and assisted by sample preparation techniques provides a versatile characterization platform to help solve real-world materials problems in industry and research.\n\nThis course will enable the participants to identify electron microscopy techniques appropriate for specific tasks, understand and interpret microscopy images, diffraction patterns, spectra, and other types of data that we can collect with a modern electron microscope. The course takes students from the fundamentals of electron microscopy and guides them to understanding the current state of the art. Participants will gain hands-on experience in acquiring, processing, interpreting and quantifying electron microscopy data.\n\nSEM: scanning electron microscopy, TEM: transmission electron microscopy, STEM: scanning transmission electron microscopy, EDS: energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, EELS: electron energy loss spectroscopy",

        "Content": "Projects are integral to engineering work. Indeed, we argue that project management is the second most important skill of engineers. Therefore, project management competences are fundamental to all DTU students.\n\nThrough the course, the student develops unique insights into how project management is practiced through the analysis of a \"real\" world project. Furthermore, each student will experience the role of the project manager as each student will be responsible for planning and executing at least one day of the group work.\n\nThe course is organized around classical and online lectures, reading material, group exercises/games and assignments, peer-reviews and multiple-choice quizzes. As a large portion of the learning activities occurs in groups, class participation is fundamental!\n\nThrough the group work, the students will analyze a real-life project. Here they are expected to apply tools, concepts, models and theories, both appropriately and critically, to understand the reasons for the project ‘success’ or ‘failure’, identify challenges and develop recommendations.\n\nIMPORTANT (TO DO BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE COURSE): Every student is expected to identify an exciting project and present it to the class on the first day of the course. The project should be completed, or close to completion, so it is possible to analyze its ‘success’.\n\nThe lectures will be in English, and we strongly encourage the students to write the final report in English. By far, most bachelor courses are in Danish. However, courses at master level are mostly, if not exclusively, in English. To facilitate the transition, DTU encourages the use of English language in some bachelor courses. This course is one of them. If the student does not feel comfortable with English, they are allowed to write the report in Danish.",

In particular, the focus will be on how pharmaceutical companies try to reach the poorest and most vulnerable segments in developing countries and what specific challenges they face in this regard. During the course we will try to understand and analyze how pharmaceutical companies measure and communicate on their impact in developing countries, including social return on investment (SROI), ESG reporting and the SDG´s. We will analyze which partnership models work most effectively in developing countries and how contextual factors influence on the economic, social and environmental effectiveness of different partnership models. As access to care increasingly rely on digital solutions and on the use of technology in facilitating access to products and services, the course will zoom in on the kinds of technologies that support sustainable business models and philanthropic activities best,\n\nThe course takes point of departure in literature on International Business, Sustainable Business Models, impact investment and finance, technology and corporate philanthropy as well as research undertaken by faculty during 2022/2023.\n\nThe course will provide insights from a number of pharmaceutical companies operating in developing countries. In particular, cases and evidence from the Novo Nordisk-Roche partnerhip on CDiC will be used extensively, and practitioners from Novo Nordisk and Roche will participate in the course.\n\nThe course is an innovative collaboration between DTU, CBS and Novo Nordisk under the EuroTeq framework, with guest lecturers from Novo Nordisk being actively involved and allowing students from different backgrounds coming together and benefiting from diverse perspectives.",
