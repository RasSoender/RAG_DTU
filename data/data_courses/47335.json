    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course, the student will get an introduction to Density Functional Theory (DFT) as one of the most used computational tools to study fundamental processes in materials for energy conversion and storage (batteries, nanocatalysts, fuel cells, photovoltaics, etc.). In the first half of the course, the students will learn the basics of the atomistic description of materials and electronic structure and the fundamentals of DFT. The second part is more practical. The students will first learn which properties can be calculated using DFT, how to bridge these quantities with the measured properties from experiments, and how to implement methodologies to automate and accelerate the design of novel materials. The course focuses on applying DFT through dedicated exercises, with limited technical details about the methodology used.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the basics of computer simulations with a focus on Density Functional Theory and the quantities that can be calculated\nDescribe the physics behind key applications for energy materials\nInterpret and adapt computer scripts for calculating physical properties of materials\nIdentify descriptors for an accelerated materials discovery approach\nCreate links between experimental results and simulations\nApply high-throughput techniques to a given data set to find novel materials\nPerform atomic scale computer simulations of identified materials for energy applications\nIdentify problems and solutions related with computer simulations and materials discovery",
    "Content": "Introduction to solid-state physics and chemistry.\nConcepts of atomistic modelling.\nPhysicochemical processes underpinning energy technologies.\nFundamentals of the atomistic and electronic structure of materials.\nDensity Functional Theory (key concepts and limitations).\nPractical use of Linux machines, scripting, ASE and GPAW packages.\nBasic and advanced exercises applied to energy materials (using ASE and GPAW).\nHigh-throughput screening approaches and autonomous workflows (examples and exercises).\n\nTwo assignments:\n1) video group presentation of an assigned research paper.\n2) short written group report summarising the final project.\nAssignments are not graded, but delivering them is a prerequisite for admission to the oral examination.",
