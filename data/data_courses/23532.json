    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give students practical competencies in beer brewing and in producing beer in accordance with the EU and Danish HACCP based regulations for safe food production. After this course you should be able to produce beer and to construct the HACCP based documentation portfolio necessary to apply for approval to start beer production in Denmark. Training in team work.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the purpose of the different parts of a brewing process\nPrepare beer wort and ferment it to beer\nPerform standard analyses during beer production and evaluate their suitability\nDesign a beer recipe and calculate the composition of the ingredients needed\nExplain the different parts of a HACCP based safe food production programme in a microbrewery\nApply the EU and Danish rules and regulations on HACCP based safe food production\nUse and modify a simple HACCP based safe food production programme for a microbrewery\nCreate a HACCP based safe food production programme for a microbrewery\nDefend their work practices and safe food production programme in an oral exam.",
    "Content": "In the course, you will be introduced to the concepts of beer brewing and then conduct experiments in the lab using home-brewing style brewery equipment (Braumeister). You will work in small groups practically with the beer brewing process from milling the grain, mashing, lautering and boiling of the wort followed by fermentation and maturation, you will document this and the relevant analyses and write this up, together with a design for a beer, in the first report. As you progress through the different aspects of the beer brewing process, you will be introduced to the EU and Danish rules on HACCP based safe food production. You will work with the HACCP based safe food production procedures (egenkontrol) that are in force in the DTU-microbrewery, which is approved for beer production by the Danish authorities and has a Danish ‘smiley’. Subsequently you will be given the task of constructing a HACCP based safe food production document set suitable for submitting to the authorities for starting beer production, which will be the second report. The course will be completed by an oral exam.",
    "Course literature": "For background reading (you do NOT need to purchase the book): ‘Brewing’ by Lewis and Young, or ‘Technology Brewing and Malting’ by Wolfgang Kunze. Please have a look at the homepage of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, most of which is in English ( https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/english/Pages/default.aspx)",
    "Remarks": "Introductory practical course in beer brewing and HACCP based safe food production.\n\nThis is a 3 weeks full time course, where you should plan to be at DTU every day from 8-17. In fact, some days will be a bit shorter and some days may be a bit longer. A plan for the course will be issued prior at the start. Almost all written material is in English, but a small amount taken from the Danish authorities is in Danish, to mitigate this, as many groups as possible will have at least one Danish speaker.\nThis course is usually oversubscribed and if so, preference will be given to DTU students from the masters in food technology and masters in biotechnology before selection of other students.",
