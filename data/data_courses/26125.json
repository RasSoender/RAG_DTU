    "Content": "The chromatographic principles and basic theoretical background of ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction and affinity chromatography, gel filtration and the expanded bed adsorption. Chromatographic systems design, including pumps and detector systems (HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography). Purification strategies and their optimization. Selection and combination of purification methods. Column materials chemical and physical properties. Packing of columns. A brief introduction to the authorities' approval of procedures for purification of protein-based drugs. Handling of proteins, as well as an introduction to other methods used in protein purification on a laboratory scale, for example, SDS-PAGE, ultrafiltration and freeze drying. The above is illustrated through experimental exercises / projects using HPLC equipment for purification of selected mainly recombinant proteins.",
