    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nEnable the student to design and layout an advanced integrated circuit block that is part of a full integrated circuit (IC) and to work in collaboration with other designers to ensure that the full IC operates at a system level.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the functionality and design challenges of an advanced integrated circuit block.\nIdentify the current state-of-the-art of an integrated circuit block with a literature research and present it.\nAnalyse and derive the requirements for the integrated circuit block together with the IC design team.\nSelect the most adequate topology of an integrated circuit block according to the specifications.\nImplement an integrated circuit block with a behavioural language.\nDesign and simulate an integrated circuit block at a transistor level as part of a full integrated circuit.\nLayout the designed integrated circuit block and extract the parasitics.\nEvaluate the performance of the designed integrated circuit block with extracted parasitics across global and local variations.\nWork as part of a team designing a full integrated circuit.\nDocument the work in a written report.",
    "Content": "The course is conducted as a project where the students work as a team of integrated circuit designers that have a common task of designing a full integrated circuit (IC).\n\nThe full IC contains several advanced IC blocks and each of the students is individually responsible for the design of one of them. The students will perform a state of the art literature search of their block, decide on an adequate circuit topology for the given specifications, design their block on schematic level, simulate it across global and local variations, layout the circuit, extract the parasitics, verify its post-extraction performance and compare it to state of the art.\n\nThe students have to collaborate with the team to find the specifications for their blocks and ensure that the blocks can interface each other.\n\nDuring the project, there will be status and review meeting where the students can update the team, share the challenges they are facing and help each other.\n\nThere will be lectures given on advanced integrated circuit blocks, chip architecture and other selected topics.",
