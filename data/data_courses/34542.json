    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe student should obtain knowledge and skills within the science, technology and art of illumination for human use. The course aims to enable the student to take productive part in a practical artificial lighting project. This is enabled by having obtained an understanding of the fundamental concepts of lighting and being able to apply them in a specific practical context and being able to experimentally verify the solutions, using modern measurement methods.\nThe course should give a theoretical understanding and practical experience with: Lighting quantities, lighting specification, lighting systems, their components, light measurement, light simulation, and lighting controls.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the fundamental physics of light as related to lighting, namely important radiometric quantities (i.e. radiant flux, radiance, radiant intensity, irradiance), together with the principles of light transport i.e. reflection, transmission, diffusion, and absorption.\nDescribe the models used for the human visual system, transforming radiometric quantities to luminous quantities and colorimetric quantities and non-visual quantities, and the quality metrics used for lighting (e.g. Color rendering , glare, correlated color temperature and efficacy)\nDescribe the overall working principle and general characteristics of relevant light sources (i.e. LED, fluorescent, discharge lamps, incandescent and daylight).\nCharacterize light sources experimentally applying the relevant characteristics i.e., luminous - and radiometric quantities and the relevant quality metrics, using different methods and instruments i.e. spectroradiometers, luminancemeters, photometers and goniophotometers.\nCreate a specification for a lighting solution to a basic target specification for a lighting application in outdoor and indoor spaces.\nCreate a design and build a model luminaire for a specific application with given requirements and specifications.\nAnalyze virtual light sources in a virtual space for a particular application using light simulation software and analyze the results.\nDescribe in general terms the wider implications of lighting on human perception, safety, health and well-being.",
    "Content": "Subjects being covered in the lectures:\n• Radiometry\n• Photometry\n• Colorimetry\n• Light sources for illumination\n• Lighting specification\n• Designing a lighting solution\n• Lighting simulating tools\n• Practical applications of lighting\n• Human factors in lighting\n• Health and well-being related to lighting\nThe experimental exercises focus on the use of light sources and optical materials for construction of lighting fixtures and the characterization of lighting fixtures for the evaluation of the performance.",
    "Remarks": "The course will intersect multiple disciplines: quantitative experimental measurements, electric energy use, energy efficiency, building physics as well as aesthetic considerations. The target group of students would therefore consist of a wide range of student interests:\n• Students wanting to design light sources and luminaries,\n• Students wanting to work on large-scale facilities including lighting installations, such as roads, buildings and public spaces,\n• Students wanting to work on underground or buried constructions, e.g. tunnels, car parks, metro stations,\n• Students wanting to work on lighting as part of the built environment to increase comfort and wellbeing of human occupants,\n• Students wanting to work with sustainable solutions for energy usage for human occupied spaces.",
