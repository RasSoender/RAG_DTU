    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course is a practical add-on course to course no. 25316 Recirculating Aquaculture Systems. As such, it is supposed to strengthen the students´ understanding and ability to evaluate the operation and performance of water treatment processes. Practical set-ups and exercises are performed on a small scale in the lab. Data achieved from trials as well as data from e.g. commercial operations will be evaluated to provide the student with an understanding of water quality parameters, dimensions and operation of commercial RAS.\nThe students will work individually as well as in small groups and get hands-on experience with basic water quality measurements and short-term experiments related to recirculating aquaculture systems. The experimental work is supposed to encourage students to put their theoretical knowledge into practice and to reflect on practical issues related to water quality measurements and system operation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply basic methods for water quality measurements\nDevelop a monitoring plan for water quality parameters in a RAS\nEstimate nutrient loads in RAS based on amount and composition of feed\nCalculate removal rates and efficiencies for central water treatment components in RAS\nPerform laboratory experiments to asses e.g. biofilter processes and disinfectant degradation kinetics; aeration efficiency; particle accumulation and size distribution\nReport data from experiments and calculation exercises\nIdentify key factors and perform central calculations within dimensioning of RAS\n-",
    "Content": "Water quality measurements in small-scale RAS, short-term laboratory experiments on water treatment processes, calculation exercises on data from larger experiments and commercial aquaculture, dimensioning of water treatment components, writing of reports",
    "Remarks": "This course provides students with competences relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #2 (Zero hunger), #12 (Responsible consumption and production) and #14 (Life below water)",
