    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the student to\n1. Describe physical working principles of components for optical communication systems and list relevant data parameters.\n2. Extract component specifications from data sheets.\n3. Design an optical communication system on the physical layer.\n4. Evaluate the expected system performance of a designed system.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe wave propagation in step-index fibres and determine requirements for single-mode propagation, explain cut-off frequency, birefringence, spot size, attenuation and nonlinear optical effects and evaluate the impact on system performance.\nExplain spontaneous emission, absorption, stimulated emission and amplification and give a theoretical explanation of the rate equations of a semiconductor laser.\nDescribe the structure and function of semiconductor lasers and light-emitting diodes including static and dynamic properties.\nDescribe the physical processes in photodiodes and the structure of optical receivers at block diagram level.\nCalculate thermal noise, shot noise, signal-to-noise ratio, bit-error rate and sensitivity in relation to the quantum limit for optical receivers.\nDefine bandwidth, saturation, optical signal to noise ratio and noise figure for Raman and erbium doped fibre amplifiers.\nEvaluate the impact of amplifier gain and noise on total system performance.\nExplain the working principles of wavelength selective devices and the application of interference and diffraction to perform wavelength filtering and the usage of these in reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers.\nDiscuss origin and predict system limitations of crosstalk in wavelength division multiplexed systems.\nExplain the building blocks of a coherent transmitter and how advanced modulation formats can be generated.\nExplain the building blocks of a coherent receiver and discuss the impact of noise on coherent detection.\nSimulate subsystems of fibre-optic transmissions systems and discuss the results.",
    "Content": "Optical fibres:\nStructure, conditions of propagation, attenuation and pulse dispersion.\nOptical amplifiers:\nConstruction, amplification, noise, Raman, EDFA.\nLight sources and transmitters:\nDevice structure, modulation bandwidth and spectral properties.\nPhotodiodes and receivers:\nDevice structure, electrical bandwidth, noise and sensitivity.\nCoherent communication:\nCoherent transmitters and receivers.\nMultichannel systems.\nComputer simulations of optical transmission.",
    "Remarks": "The course 34130 distinguish itself from 34121 by treating the different parts of optical communications systems more in-depth.\nThis course is the theoretical counterpart of the experimental optical communication system course 34126 and 34129; the courses complement each other.\nThis course provides the basis for advanced courses in optical communication such as 34153 Physical Concepts in Optical Communication and 34156 Advanced Optical Communication Systems.\nFor students who previously have been following the course 34361 Optical Networks, this course provides a more in-depth treatment of optics in communication on the physical layer",
