    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe field of infectious disease epidemiology is multifaceted, encompassing everything from understanding disease distribution within populations to evaluating interventions. This course will introduce key concepts, methods, and applications of quantitative epidemiology, including modeling disease spread, identifying risk factors, and assessing the efficacy of interventions. Surveillance plays a crucial role in detecting outbreaks, tracking trends, and evaluating adverse effects. Students will also learn how to develop and evaluate surveillance programs, and the importance of sampling plans.\nSurveillance Data-Driven Risk Assessment and Communication to Inform Management: develop skills to analyze and interpret surveillance data for assessing risks associated with infectious diseases and to effectively inform management about the identified risks and proposed interventions.\nApplied Epidemiology to Inform Decision Making: apply epidemiological principles and methods to inform decision-making processes in disease eradication efforts and to evaluate the impact of various interventions on disease transmission.\nFrom Individual to Population Level Surveillance Data Planning/Interpretation: understand the transition from individual-level data to population-level insights in disease surveillance, and develop skills for planning and interpreting population-level surveillance data (e.g. prevalence or freedom of disease metrics).\nMonitoring vs Surveillance: be able to differentiate between monitoring and surveillance, focusing on actionable outcomes that lead to effective interventions; learn how to evaluate a surveillance system in its various components.\nPractical Importance of Sampling Design and its Interaction with Different Diagnostic Methods: explore the significance of robust sampling designs in enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic methods, and evaluate the different sampling designs’ effectiveness, considering their interaction with various diagnostic approaches.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSelect the most appropriate modelling approach and diagnostic tools for a given epidemiological purpose\nSketch, in a team, an integrated surveillance programme for a zoonotic disease, including choice of methodologies and tools\nExplain and evaluate the different components of a surveillance system\nDefine performance measures of diagnostic tests\nExplain how the test performance and the sampling design can affect the performance of a surveillance system\nDescribe the results of mathematical models that predict the spread of infectious diseases in a defined population\nAnalyse and interpret data from existing national and international surveillance programmes of infectious diseases, antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance\nPerform, in a team, investigation of food and water associated disease outbreaks\nExplain how genomic data (WGS) from pathogens can be used to elucidate transmission pathways and trace the sources of infections\nInterpret epidemiological studies that investigate drivers/risk factors for infectious diseases or the efficacy of vaccines/treatment\nSelect the appropriate study type and statistical test for a given epidemiological investigation\nEstimate and interpret burden of disease measures (DALY) for prioritization of interventions",
    "Content": "History of Infectious Diseases: evolution of infectious diseases throughout human history and their societal impact; historical successes and failures in disease control; Types of Infectious Agents: unique characteristics and challenges posed by viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance; Zoonoses: diseases that cross species boundaries (zoonoses) and their implications for human health and wildlife conservation.\nSurveillance Systems Design and Evaluation: design of effective surveillance systems and evaluation of surveillance components. Early outbreak detection and monitoring of disease trends; Epidemiological Studies: design and interpretation of epidemiological studies. Difference between causality and association. Evaluate treatment options and their impact on disease outcomes; Modeling Disease Spread: modelling approaches to simulate disease dynamics in a population. Predicting outbreaks, assessing intervention strategies, and understanding transmission patterns; Drivers of Infectious Diseases: global, regional, and local factors influencing disease prevalence. One Health—connecting animal, human, and environmental health; Identifying Risk Factors: risk factors contributing to disease transmission and prioritization of interventions based on evidence; Genomics and Prediction: whole genome sequencing data (WGS) for disease surveillance. Prediction of pathogen behavior, drug resistance, and emerging variants. Precision epidemiology; Big Data and Digital Epidemiology: data-driven approaches for real-time monitoring.
