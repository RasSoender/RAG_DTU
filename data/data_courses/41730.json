    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the students to analyse complex bulk and sheet metal forming processes by theoretical/numerical methods.\nTo apply these analyses in: 1) determining the conditions in the interior of the material during as well as after processing, 2) determining favorable process and tool parameters and materials and 3) designing and dimension metal forming tools.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nanalytically describe isotropic and anisotropic materials characteristics\napply the slab method and upper bound method to plane and rotational symmetric forming operations\nselect appropriate tool materials for metal forming\ncalculate strains, strain rates and stresses during deformation\ncalculate resulting properties such as flow stress and hardness distribution of metal formed components\ncalculate limits of formability as function of material and process parameters\ndesign and dimension tools for metal forming\nsuggest appropriate forming processes for specific components\noptimize forming processes including multistep operations",
    "Content": "1) Bulk metal forming: theoretical/numerical methods of analysis, drawing of rod and wire (process planning and optimization), cold, warm and hot extrusion and closed die forging (workpiece and tool materials and coatings, process analysis, tool design and dimensioning). 2) Sheet metal forming: modelling and testing of anisotropy, theoretical instability, testing of formability, process analysis of deep drawing and stretch forming. 3) Types of presses and selection of presses for different forming operations.",
