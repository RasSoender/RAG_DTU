    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nDefects are inherent in solids and play an important role in governing their physical behaviour. Therefore, it is pertinent to learn tools for characterisation of defects and understand their behaviour in order to engineer better materials for variety of applications such as dosimetry, bio-imaging, geochronology, pressure gauging, thermometry, photonics, quantum technologies and photovoltaics. This inter-disciplinary course is an introduction to the basic principles and main applications of defects in insulators, with a strong focus on hands-on experience. A broad range of experiments will cover material characterisation, luminescence physics, ionising radiation dosimetry and geochronology.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the importance of metastable states in insulators for different applications\nExplain various kind of defects\nExplain how insulators acquire colour\nCharacterise luminescent defects using different probing techniques\nMeasure defect energy structure, and explain charge transfer processes in relation to the band model\nExplain the formation of metastable states\nExplain how metastable states are used for their memory as passive sensors of heat and light\nPerform numerical analysis of luminescence data for defect characterisation or sensing applications\nEvaluate uncertainties in quantities derived from luminescence measurements\nExplain the principles of luminescence dosimetry\nApply one or more material systems for measurement of absorbed dose using OSL\nConceptualise a project on application of luminescent defects and summarise project results in a report",
    "Content": "This three-week course comprises lectures on defect related luminescence and experimental work. Most of the course will be carried out at DTU Physics, Risø campus using the infrastructure of the RADPHYS section. Some lectures and exercises will be carried out at DTU Physics, Lyngby campus (QPIT section). Data analysis can be carried out using the students' own computers. The course consists of the following elements:\n(i) lectures (defect related luminescence in insulators and its applications),\n(ii) studying literature related to the project problem (research papers),\n(iii) measurements and experiments,\n(iv) data analysis\n(v) project, student presentations, and report writing.",
    "Course literature": "Books, Articles, Software manuals\nTilley, R.J., 2008. Defects in solids. John Wiley & Sons.",
    "Remarks": "Depending on the number of students, it may be necessary to split the class into groups.\nWeek I and II: Lectures and experiments in parallel\nWeek III: Supplementary measurements, as well as report writing/presentations.",
