    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nMulti-carrier energy systems are characterized by strong operational and planning coordination across multiple energy systems, including electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, and district heating, to exploit the synergies between the energy carriers, improve the reliability and cost-effectiveness of energy delivery with minimal impact on the environment. The aim of the course is to give the students the necessary background knowledge of multi-carrier energy systems. The students will learn to model and solve the basic operational problems in individual energy systems, and analyze their integration.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the structure of multi-carrier energy (electricity, heat, natural gas and hidrogen) systems and components at the interface between them.\nExplain the synergies between the energy sectors and the concepts of sector coordination.\nDescribe the optimal energy flow problem for different energy carriers and the approaches to solve it.\nFormulate the optimal power flow problem for transmission and radial distribution systems on a computer.\nFormulate the optimal gas flow problem on a computer.\nFormulate the optimal heat flow problem on a computer.\nExplain the similarities between energy flow problems for different energy carriers, and the multi-energy flow problem.\nInterpret, analyze, and present numerical results.",
