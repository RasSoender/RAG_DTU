    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nChemical engineers often work with research, product development, production, marketing and sale of chemical or biochemical products. Product design relates to all of these areas. After this course you will be familiar with situations which are typical in product innovation in the chemical, biochemical and farmaceutical industries. Generally, you will be capable of organising and handling new product design. You will be able to analyse products and the needs of the customers. You will know how to generate innovative new product concepts and execute decision-making based on product performance. You can evaluate products quantitativly and select the optimal product concepts. Furthermore, you will be ready to develop product specifications, product recipe and process conditions, as well as dealing with the marketing and selling of the product. Finally, you will be able to evaluate the effect of a product on the environment and the global climate in light of the 17 UN sustainability goals. To put it briefly, you will be able to conduct a focused product design project.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nwork profesionally in teams while relating to own personal strengths and weaknesses\nconduct analyses and orientations around a product\nanalyse for customer needs\ndevelop simple quantitative models for describing product behaviour\nset up a product specification\nbe innovative, i.e. generate ideas and create product concepts\ndevelop and select the best concepts amongst many concepts\ndescribe and characterize a product concept\ngenerate a lab-scale recipe for a product\ndiscuss issues of relevance for production of chemical products\nevaluate a product in relation to the 17 UN sustainability goals",
    "Content": "This course will teach you to follow a specific approach to product design. During the course you work in teams and make one report focusing on a chemical and biochemical product to be selected from a list of potential ideas.\n\nYou will work with the following issues: The role of the chemical engineer in product design. Organisation of the process of product development. Organisation in teams of colleagues and project groups. Project management. Brainstorming to generate ideas. Patenting of products and IPR. Interview of customers. The development process. Development and use of simple mathematical models to estimate product performance. Selection between product ideas and concepts. Performing engineering calculations on products in order to make a quantitative evaluation of product concepts. Develop lab scale recipe. Evaluate a product footprint according to the UN sustainability goals.",
    "Remarks": "The following textbook is used in the course: Wesselingh, J.A., Kiil, S., Vigild, M.E. (2007) Design and development of biological, chemical, food and pharmaceutical products, Wiley.",
