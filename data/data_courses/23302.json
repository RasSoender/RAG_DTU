    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will give the student the ability to apply food chemistry knowledge to foods. This includes chemical reactions and physical changes that involve, e.g., lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, and the effect of these reactions/changes on the macroscopic food properties. The course enables the students to evaluate the influence of processing and storage on selected food items (e.g. meat, fish, cereals, vegetables).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify and describe food components, classify them according to their chemical composition and list their functions\nDescribe chemical reactions and physical changes occurring during processing (production, home food preparation) and storage of food\nDiscuss how chemical reactions and physical changes during processing or storage can be enhanced or mitigated\nRelate chemical reactions and physical changes to macroscopic food properties\nDescribe important chemical reactions and physical changes for selected food items\nDiscuss important chemical reactions and physical changes for selected food items\nMake a concise written report on the physico-chemical aspects of a selected food item\nPresent a scientific paper related to food chemistry",
    "Content": "The course will consist of a general description of water, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, emulsions, food improvement agents, micro- and nanoparticles and their chemical reactions (e.g. Maillard reaction, lipid oxidation) and physical changes in relation to food. The students will apply the obtained knowledge to a selected food item and present their findings in the form of a poster and a written report. In addition, the students will practice the presentation of data from scientific manuscripts about food chemistry aspects.",
