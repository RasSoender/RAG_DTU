    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe goal is to give students an understanding of dialogue methods for the involvement of actors and artefacts in the innovation processes, and expertice in facilitation of co-creation workshops. The course will enable students to analyse, select, develop and test techniques/tools for the active involvement of practitioners in real or simulated design processes. The focus will be on approaches such as user-driven innovation, participatory design, participatory innovation and co-creation. The students should show deep knowledge and reflect on the different approaches' significance with respect to staged dialogue, the further design process and its outcome. The course will give students a broad foundation for involving, staging and facilitating processes in which different actors are involved in interdisciplinary dialogue, in front-end innovation, idea generation, synthesis and in the testing of design solutions, performance, etc. as well as a theoretical basis for reflecting on these based on the course's curriculum literature. The course will involve a number of real world tasks and students will be expected to work in teams to carry out co-creation activities for a range of problems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEvaluate the effectiveness of involving stakeholders in the design processes by critiquing the advantages and disadvantages based on case study examples and existing literature.\nAssess the impact of using boundary objects in multidisciplinary dialogues, comparing various case study examples to determine the most effective practices and contexts for their use.\nEvaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using universal design to promote interdisciplinary collaboration.\nStage processes for co-creative dialogue and reflect on the facilitator role in these.\nAnalyse benefits and drawbacks in modern methods promoting cross disciplinary collaboration.\nStage and reflect on the use of workshop co-creation techniques in the design process.\nDesign a comprehensive workshop that strategically implements the theory of constraints and creativity to enhance the co-creation process\nCritique the workshop design by evaluating how the theory of constraints and creativity influence the outcomes of the co-creation process, suggesting improvements based on empirical evidence and theoretical insights.",
    "Content": "The focus of the course is to analyse how to involve different actors and artefacts in the design process, where the goal is to create knowledge-building dialogues. We will analyze the historical development of actor-involvement and see how this has progressed from looking at a user as an object of study or test person to looking at use practice and other actors as 'co-creators'. We will examine and discuss a range of approaches to user involvement, such as: usability, design labs, generative sessions, video, performance, design games, and participatory innovation.",
    "Course literature": "Course literature will be uploaded to Inside throughout the course on a week-by-week basis",
