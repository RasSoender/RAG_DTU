    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give an introduction to advanced methods for time series analysis. The primary goal to give a thorough knowledge on modelling dynamic systems. Special attention is paid on non-linear and non-stationary systems, and the use of stochastic differential equations for modelling physical and technical systems. The main goal is to obtain a solid knowledge on methods and tools for using time series for setting up models for real life systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply methods for building stochastic dynamic models\nIdentify the need for a non-linear model\nIdentify the need for a non-stationary model\nKnowledge about a number of non-linear and non-stationary model classes\nEstablish models in discrete and continuous time\nDifferentiate between methods for formulating stochastic models\nApply stochastics models for prediction\nKnowledge about using stochastic differential equations for modelling\nApply non-parametric and semi-parametric methods\nCalculate predictions of time series\nEstimate parameters in stochastic dynamic models\nIDocument and present results in a written report.",
    "Content": "Non-linear time series models. Kernel estimators and time series analysis. Identification of non-linear models. State space models. Prediction in non-linear models. State filtering. Stochastic differential equations. Estimation of linear and (some) non-linear stochastic differential equations. Experimental design for dynamic identification. Methods for tracking parameters in non-stationary time series. Examples of both non-linear and non-stationary models. Non-linear models and chaos. Model building for real life systems. The final contents of the course will be discussed with the students.",
