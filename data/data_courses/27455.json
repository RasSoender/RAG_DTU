    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with complementary knowledge and fundamental understanding of the effects that the different types of bioprocess setups have on the microbial performance during bio-based industrial production, thereby targeting different fields, ranging from the molecular biology perspective, over metabolic pathways, to cellular signaling and regulation.\nAfter this course, the students will be able to perform a detailed analysis of the expected effects of a bioprocess setup on the production organism, predict the metabolic burden, and hence suggest solutions to optimize the bioreaction process from the microbial perspective.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify the possible stress factors which a cell factory will experience in the different phases of production of a particular product, or in a specific fermentation process; and provide methods for the genetic engineering of cell factories to the anticipated stresses and increase stress resistance.\nClassify different reactor designs and list their benefits and drawbacks in relation to delivering a uniform growth environment and/or imposing cell factory stress.\nEvaluate different fermentation processes (batch, fed-batch, continuous etc.) and their benefits and drawbacks in relation to delivering a uniform growth environment and/or imposing cell factory stress.\nReflect how scaling of a fermentation process may affect the possibility to deliver uniform growth environments to cell factories.\nRecognize how fermentation processes in ideal fermenters with uniform growth environments will still impose cell factory stress (e.g. substrate imposed stress, forced production stress, pH, osmolarity, product imposed stress, nutrient or oxygen limitation stress).\nReflect on how fermentation in industrial fermenters with more or less heterogeneous growth environments imposes additional stress on cell factories and results in decreased and unpredictable product yields.\nDetermine how different product types (bulk chemicals, fine chemicals, bulk protein, refined proteins, or live cells) affect the choice of the fermentation process and downstream processing, as well as the possible stress factors.\nEvaluate how different substrate and medium types (pure components, partially purified components, specialized rich growth media, by-products from bioproduction, material from dairy or farming, lignocellulose by-product from forestry or farming) determine the choice of the fermentation process as well as the possible stress factors.\nRecognize the biochemical mechanisms behind the stress responses towards the industrially most important cell factory stress types (carbon source limitation, energy source limitation, nitrogen limitation, oxygen limitation, overflow metabolism, protein secretion stress).\nDesign possible ways to genetically engineer cell factories to the anticipated stress and increase stress resistance.\nCreate solutions for specific problems in industrial fermentation and defend or modify the solutions.",
    "Content": "• Advanced insights into microbial physiology and biochemistry in fermentation processes\n• Toxicity and fermentation inhibitors\n• Abiotic stresses\n• Regulation of metabolism\n• Product specific stress (e.g. enzymes, protein therapeutics, biofuels, bulk chemicals, and secondary metabolites)\n• Engineering of metabolic networks\n• Challenges in process scaling (up/down) and monitoring\n• Other relevant stresses\n• The students will work in groups with theoretical exercises (based on experimental data from fermentations) and will provide qualified feedback to the contributions of other groups",
    "Course literature": "Reviews, original scientific literature, and selected textbook chapters.",
    "Remarks": "• This course is mainly offered for MSc Biotechnology and MSc Chemical and Biochemical Engineering students.\n• Mandatory for the fermentation based biomanufacturing study lines in each MSc education mentioned above\n• Students taking this course may also be interested in course 28455 Process adaptation in Fermentation Based Biomanufacturing (http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/28455) (autumn)",
