    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nanalyse an application scenario and identify common threats, vulnerabilities and risks;\nsurvey the research literature and select relevant solutions for a given security problem in a distributed system;\ncompare and contrast these techniques with respect to achieving a specific security goal in a specific security context;\ndesign a distributed application or system that employs advanced cryptographic techniques and protocols;\nevaluate a proposed cryptographic solution for a specific security problem;\ndocument their work with the security process in a clear and concise report;\npresent and defend (orally) a complex cryptographic solution;\nprovide constructive criticism (orally and written) on cryptographic solutions proposed by third parties.",
    "Content": "The course introduces practical design and security analysis of cryptographic solutions. The necessary cryptographic basics and methodology are introduced in the course.\nStudents will work in groups on a given security problem, going through the phases of analysis, design, evaluation and documentation of a cryptographic solution to the particular problem. Students will be required to analyse the solutions proposed by other groups and to provide constructive criticism on those solutions.",
