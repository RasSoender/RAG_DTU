    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe Earth's gravity field varies with location depending on the composition of the materials in the subsurface and time as a function of climatic and geodynamic processes. These variations impact the shape of the Earth and cause the water in the oceans not to coincide with a simple surface but depend on the gravity field variations. Data from gravity field satellites provide unique monitoring of the melt of the ice sheets, sea level rise, and global ocean circulation.\n\nThe goal of the course is to provide the students with advanced knowledge about mathematical models, advanced methodology for determining gravity field variations, and the use of satellites for gravity field measurements and determination of auxiliary data such as digital terrain models and use of gravity field data in moderne geodetic mapping, geophysics and climate monitoring.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the gravity field variations as a function of time and place and its role in geodesy, surveying and climate change applications.\nBe able to use and understand advanced methods for modelling gravity and other potential fields in 3D (globally and regionally), including auxiliary uses in geophysics and earth observation.\nBe able to download and use satellite data (GRACE, GOCE) and global spherical harmonic models for use in gravity field modelling, geoid determination, and climate change applications. Climate applications of gravity changes.\nBe able to download and handle digitial terrain models for use in physical geodesy\nBe able to use airborne gravity measurements, understand error sources from aircraft positioning, and the optimal combination of in-situ, airborne and satellite data.\nGet knowledge of new technologies for gravity measurement (quantum sensors, inertial sensors, next generation gravity satellite missions)\nUnderstand background and error sources in marine gravity measurement by satellite altimetry, and their use for geoid determination and ocean circulation\nWork independently on a regional geodetic/geophyscal project, including being able to use advanced geodetic software from different sources\nPresent scientific project work.\nRelevant for UN SDG goal 9 (\"Industry, innovation and infrasructure) and goal 13 (\"Climate Action\") - special focus 2025 on climate change applications",
