    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course, students will learn how to model experiences for virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, etc (collectively xR). Initially, students are introduced to methods and technologies for acquisition of geometry, material appearance, and illumination. This is followed by a series of lectures on technologies for xR and content modelling methods. Starting from roughly the middle of the semester, students do their own modeling for an xR experience in a project which stretches over the last half of the semester. The results should be described in a report which is handed in at the end of the semester.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ncapture light and geometry of an environment, e.g. in the form of light fields\ncapture 3D models using time of flight cameras or structured light scanning\ncapture appearance of real objects\nuse acquired content in 3D scenes for xR\nlight and shade a virtual environment\napply stereoscopic rendering\nmodel content using 3D content creation tools\ndesign and implement xR experiences and interaction\nchoose appropriate technologies for xR experiences\nmake informed decisions on how to store and distribute data for digital visual experiences",
    "Content": "Environment capture using LiDAR, SLAM, photogrammetry. Object acquisition using time of flight and structured light. Capturing material appearance using photography, shaders for photo realistic rendering, interaction methods in xR using controllers, accelerometers, touch, headsets for xR, technologies for AR with handheld devices, Unity3D or similar tools for VR experiences.",
