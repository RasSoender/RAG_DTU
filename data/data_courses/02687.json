    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course provides a solid knowledge of theory and practice of Scientific Computing for numerical solution of differential equation systems arising in science and engineering. The participants learn to develop, analyze, implement and apply various numerical methods and algorithms for solution of steady-state and time-dependent ordinary (ODEs) and partial differential equation systems (PDEs). The techniques are relevant for any type of differential equations, incl. stocastic differential equations (SDEs). Data-driven methods within the emerging area of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) arre introduced. SciML combines techniques from mathematics-physics modelling, scientific computing and statistics. The experience gained is useful for the solution and study of mathematical problems arising in engineering and science applications.",
