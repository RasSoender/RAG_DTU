    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe learning objective of the course is to prepare a student for development of the mathematical models for industrially important applications, and for analyzing such models analytically and numerically.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nTo produce a mathematical model for description of the industrial processes, developing in space and time, and involving transport of matter and energy by convection and diffusion, as well as chemical reactions;\nTo formulate initial and boundary conditions for a mathematical problem applying relevant physical considerations;\nTo learn and to be able of working with the differential balances. To formulate mathematical problems for the systems involving such balances. To select the solution methods for these problems;\nTo develop the algorithms for solution of the systems of ordinary differential equations based on the standard library procedures;\nTo implement such algorithms into the computer codes on modern programming languages;\nTo apply the methods for qualitative analysis and numerical solution of the coupled systems of differential equations, including stiff problems;\nTo analyze the obtained solutions in terms of the dimensionless parameters of the systems;\nTo check stability of the systems and find the values of the critical parameters.",
    "Content": "Teaching is built around a number of model examples, which broadly describe the statements of the problems with the chemical- and biochemical contents. The problems are solved numerically, applying programming as a tool. The possible model examples are (the choice may be different in the different years):\n\nModelling of the enzymatic hydrolyses\n\nModeling the chromatographic processes\n\nModeling of the diffusion through the coating\n\nModeling of adsorption separations\n\nModeling of the filtration of water containing solid particles",
    "Course literature": "The teaching materials for the course are notes and additional materials uploaded to the course website (DTU Inside/DTU Learn).",
