    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course’s intention is to enhance the engineering student’s ability to design bridge structures, including conceptual design, qualified selection of statical systems, global and local structural analysis, structural dimensioning at different detailing levels. Particular emphasis on cable-supported bridges. Various bridge types are presented, followed by a detailed examination of the bridge's constituent components, their structual function and mutual structural interaction. Specialist issues, such as dynamic loading and construction engineering (erection methods) are introduced.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDisplay a historical overview of bridge types\nDescribe the structrural behaviour of various types of bridges\nChoose an optimal bridge configuration for a particular span and particular foundation condition\nUnderstand the differences between different cable-supported bridges, such as suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges\nExamine the various components of a bridge\nDescribe the load paths for different bridges\nHave knowledge of basic aerodynamic phenomena for longer-span bridges\nPerform conceptual design, preliminary design and analysis of various types of bridges, such as continuous beam bridges, cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges.\nPerform detailed analysis and design of bridge components in prestressed concrete, structural steel and steel-concrete composite members\nAnalyse the effects of moving trafic loads\nDiscuss construction techniques",
    "Content": "-Bridge history and design assumptions\n-Selection of bridge spans, design considerations\n-Study of suspension and cable-stayed bridges with long spans\n-Investigate the various components of a bridge\n-Bridge dynamics\n-Special bridges, for example. pedestrian bridges\n-Bridge construction techniques",
