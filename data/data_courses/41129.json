    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain and derive the basic equations that govern turbulent flows including turbulence modelling\napply these to analyse turbulent flows, such as steady, uniform boundary layers in channels, pipes, etc., and free shear flows\nanalyse turbulent flows using statistical analyses such as probability distribution of turbulent velocities, correlation and spectrum analyses\ncompose a complete picture of the turbulent energy balance in simple flows using basic equations, statistical and spectral analysis, and physical reasoning\ncompare and contrast steady and unsteady (exemplified with oscillatory boundary layer) turbulent flows, including the occurrence of laminar-to-turbulent transition\nexplain turbulent transport processes\napply and evaluate results from turbulence models, ranging from simple models (e.g., the mixing length model) to more advanced models (e.g. k-omega)\nanalyze and evaluate results from laboratory experiments using advanced facilities/techniques",
    "Content": "(1) Introduction. (2) Basic equations (continuity, equation of motion and energy equations). (3) Steady boundary layer flows (flow close to a wall, flow across the entire section, turbulence-modelling, flow resistance, bursting process). (4) Statistical analysis (correlation analysis, spectrum analysis). (5) Free shear flows. (6) Turbulent transport processes (one-particle analysis, Taylor’s theory of diffusion by continuous motions, longitudinal dispersion, dispersion coefficient, longitudinal dispersion in rivers, etc.). (7) Unsteady boundary layers (laminar oscillatory boundary layer, transition, turbulent oscillatory boundary layers). (8) Turbulence models.",
