    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim is to provide participants with general skills and knowledge necessary to design, analyze and adapt urban drainage and stormwater systems under the influence of growing urbanization, increasing demands for pollution control and needs for climate change adaptation. Knowledge is provided on the most important hydraulic and hydrological processes, as well as statistics on extreme rainfall, wet-weather pollution discharges and flooding. Skills are provided in the traditional way of dimensioning urban drainage and stormwater systems by hand calculation as well as in the use of a state-of-the-art software for static and dynamic simulation of drainage systems under heavy rain (e.g. SCALGO, MIKE+). The course focuses on both water quantity and quality and will introduce both traditional and novel solutions to managing stormwater - including both technical stormwater control measures, nature based solutions, and new digital data products and real-time control principles.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDesign simple urban drainage and stormwater management systems, below and above ground\nAnalyse existing systems to identify areas in risk of flooding\nPropose a range of solutions to solve flooding/surcharge, overflow and pollution problems, and document the effect of these solutions\nDimension the most important system structures such as pipes, basins and overflow structures as well as nature based solutions and local infiltration devices\nUse advanced digital tools simulation software for urban stormwater systems (e.g. MIKE+)\nUnderstand the perspective of latest trends in digitalization of urban drainage systems - including new data and model products and digital twins\nQuantify frequency and volume of overflows\nEstimate pollutant loads to recipients\nChoose between different types of raindata for use on different types of problems\nIdentify the main sources of uncertainty in model assessments and compare to uncertainty from climate change and growth of cities",
