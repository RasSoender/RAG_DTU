    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo describe all significant hydrodynamic forces on fixed, bottom-supported and floating marine structures / vessels such that the student will be able to perform overall load and motion estimations as well as detailed numerical calculations of actual structures / vessels.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe flow processes around slender marine structures with cylindrical structural elements (or structure), such as marine pipelines, offshore wind turbine foundations, and fixed offshore platforms.\ndescribe processes related to current and wave forces / loads on these structures.\nexplain and analyse the in-line drag and inertia forces (the Morison equation).\nexplain and analyse the cross-flow (lift) force.\napply the Morison equation (in-line force) and cross-flow (lift) force to evaluate the stability of simple marine structures (e.g. marine pipelines).\ndescribe flow processes around large bodies (a large vertical circular cylinder) and analyse the forces on these structures.\ndescribe and evaluate vortex- and flow-induced vibrations and motions\nexplain and analyse irregular wave time series in time and frequency domain, short-term and long-term statistics\ncharacterize and describe ocean wave systems in terms of sea states and wave energy density spectra\ndescribe and apply motion transfer functions to investigate the seakeeping ability of floating structures / vessels (e.g. ships)\napply the Morison equation for a simple analysis of bottom-supported and floating structures\ndescribe the fundamentals related to strength calculations of long floating structures / vessels (e.g. ships)",
    "Content": "Short- and long-term marine wave climate in the time and frequency domain offshore and on deep water (irregular and three-dimensional waves, ocean wave spectra); Current and wave forces on cylindrical structures applicable to marine pipelines/cables, offshore wind turbine foundations and fixed and bottom-supported offshore platforms (drag and inertia forces, and the Morison equation, cross-flow lift forces).
