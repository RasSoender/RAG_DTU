    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course, you will work with 3D images (volumes). 3D imaging is particularly useful if you want to investigate the internal structure of a material on a microscopic level without destroying the sample you are imaging. You can use this in a wide range of areas from medicine to materials research. To use 3D imaging you need to combine knowledge from three areas: image acquisition, processing, and analysis. And of course, you need to know the sample you are studying. In this course, you will get the skills that will enable you to use 3D imaging as a research tool.\n\nThe methods we will discuss will be general and applicable to any 3D volumetric (i.e. made of voxels) images like those, for instance, from magnetic resonance imaging. However, a special emphasis will be put on 3D x-ray µCT imaging (micro-computed-tomography) because of our close relationship with the 3D imaging center at DTU and with the MAX IV synchrotron in Lund (a new world-class research facility that offers unique opportunities within 3D imaging).\n\nThe most difficult, but also fun and rewarding part of 3D imaging, is analyzing the images. In this course, you will get the practical skills to carry out advanced visualization and analysis, and you do not need to have worked with image analysis before. Throughout the course, you will use high-performance computing when analyzing large 3D images.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ncarry out experimental 3D imaging including scanning, retrieving data, and reconstructing a 3D volume,\ndescribe the mathematical building blocks of images and image processing,\nselect and apply appropriate image analysis methods for 3D images,\nimplement analysis methods for image processing and segmentation of 3D images using Python,\nselect the appropriate 3D visualization methods and tools to inspect 3D images,\nuse the obtained skills to carry out a small research project.\ncould give practical examples of the use of laboratory and synchrotron micro-CT scanning,\nuse a high-performance computing system and manage parallelism, memory, and resources,",
    "Content": "You will learn the core skills necessary for using 3D imaging including setting up scans, writing code, using software tools, and experimenting with data.\n\nYou will learn about useful methods for image reconstruction, segmentation, filtering morphology, feature extraction, and quantification. You will do so from a mathematical/physical perspective and then the hands-on use/implementation with Python.\n\nYou will familiarize yourself with software tools for visualization and data exploration and learn to calculate statistics of the shape and sizes of the imaged structures.\n\nYou will learn about the management of performance when processing your data, how to measure execution time, use memory resources, and parallel computing.\n\n3D images are often very large, and a single image can be several GB, making data handling and processing challenging on a normal PC. Therefore, you will learn to use high-performance computing systems that enable the processing of large amounts of data. You will use the Gbar.\n\nThrough the course, you will gain the necessary confidence to write your code for developing image processing pipelines that are suitable for 3D imaging. You will gain prerequisites for working further within 3D imaging, image analysis, and/or high-performance computing.",
