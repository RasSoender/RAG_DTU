    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo equip students with knowledge about the latest biotechnological advances in food as well as the methods and production processes used during production of food or feed ingredients, probiotics, biochemicals, plant based and alternative protein sources, etc. Though the course the students will gain sufficient knowledge and understanding which will enable them to further their research and development skills within all areas which include elements of microbial production. Lectures from representatives from companies will also strengthen the students’ appreciation of the journey from theory to application and production in real-life cases.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nOutline how starter cultures are produced, used and how they function within industries such as dairy, bread, brewing and meat industry\nExplain how pre- and probiotic bacteria are used and which potential interactions they may have with the intestine and the intestinal flora\nChoose suitable microbial production hosts for various food ingredients such as protein, nisin, MSG, vitamins, aroma compounds, enzymes, polymers.\nEvaluate how and which enzymes can be applied in food production\nDesign strategies for production of new food ingredients using traditional breeding and genetic modification of microorganisms\nAnalyse the potential and challenges of alternatives to animal meat production, including plant based protein sources\nOutline how side streams from agriculture and food industries can turned into ressources and value-added products via biorefining and microbial fermentation\nEvaluate the positive and negative environmental effects of biotechnology and biorefining, including the regulations governing the field.",
    "Content": "Application of microbiology and biotechnology in food processes and production of food and feed ingredients. Which microbes are used in food production; how do they behave and how is the taste, flavor, rheology and shelf life affected? How do the bacteria we eat affect our health and can we change the bacterial content in the intestine to improve health?\nHow can new microorganisms be developed for production of food ingredients using either traditional breeding and screening techniques or using gene technologies and synthetic biology? What does food production in the future look like? Can we make \"meat\" using plant materials or using microbially produced ingredients? Can waste and side streams from the food industry be eliminated and instead turned into valuable resources for production of food and food ingredients? How does a more efficient utilization of our resources affect the global food supply and the environment?",
