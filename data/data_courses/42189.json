    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course is about understanding the dynamics of transport systems. Students will gain knowledge on key mathematical methods used to model travel demand and supply in complex mobility systems.\nApplications encompass a wide range of traditional as well as emerging modes of transport; spanning both private and public sectors, and travelers and cargo alike.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe fundamental techniques and aggregation levels for modelling transport systems\nFormulate and apply generation and distribution of travel\nAnalyse travel mode choice using logit and nested logit models\nOperate and evaluate a demand model for transport analysis\nApply and assess different measures typically used to evaluate the performance of transport systems\nImplement, analyse and argue the strengths and weaknesses of different modelling and solution methods to solve traffic assignment problems\nExplain the structure of transport system models and discuss feedback mechanisms\nCreate and apply a combined transport model to evaluate the impacts of potential policies\nWrite technical notes and use traditional mathematical software for the analysis of transport systems and network performance",
    "Content": "The course covers quantitative methods that can be used to solve problems within transport modelling, and is built around 3 interconnected modules: demand (D), supply (S) and DS interactions. Related to demand modelling, the course focuses on statistical and mathematical methods, especially regression, discrete choice models, iterative proportional fitting in matrix estimation, and gravitation models.\nRelated to supply we focus on the performance of transport networks, traffic flow theory, network modelling and queueing. Finally, within demand-supply interactions we will focus on equilibrium analysis and traffic assignment. In addition to introducing the underlying fundamentals, the course will include numerous case-studies from different transportation settings. The classes are taught in an interactive manner, with theoretical parts combined with hands-on exercises using an interactive notebook environment. Knowledge of coding is not a must, although some exercises will be presented in Python.",
