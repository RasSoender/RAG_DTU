    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will provide: (1) general and specific knowledge about several key organic pollutants and (2) general and specific knowledge of transport, distribution and transformation processes that control the exposure, fate and toxicity of these and other organic contaminants.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nHas general and specific knowledge about several key groups of organic pollutants with special emphasis on persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT).\nWill have a general knowledge of the physico-chemical properties of several key groups of organic pollutants.\nCan identify the governing processes for organic pollutants and evaluate how they affect their fate, exposure and effects in the environment.\nCan relate these processes to the molecular structure and the physico-chemical properties of the pollutants.\nCan relate these processes to the characteristics of the environmental compartment.\nCan identify and evaluate the factors that affect the bioavailability and exposure of chemical compounds in various matrices.\nHas up to date knowledge about recent trends on PMT substances, PFAS and UVCBs.\nUnderstand the importance of persistence as priority criteria and the molecular features that are associated with high persistence.",
    "Content": "The first part of the course covers selected key processes that control the fate, exposure and effects of organic pollutants in the environment. These processes fall within the general categories of transport (diffusion, advection, co-transport), distribution (partitioning, adsorption, entrapment) and transformations (e.g. biodegradation, photodegradation and hydrolysis). These processes will be introduced and described within an environmental organic chemistry context.\nThe second part of the course covers a selection of key contaminant groups: (1) Legacy persistent organic pollutants (PCBs, DDTs, dioxins), (2) Brominated Flameretardants, (3) Fluorinated organic pollutants (PFAS), (4) Polyaromatic hydrocarbons including alkylated and hydroxylated PAHs, (5) Polymer additives, (6) Persistent, mobile and toxic chemicals (PMT chemicals), (7) Pharmaceuticals and (8) UVCBs. For each group, there will be emphasis on sources and inputs to the environment, physico-chemical properties, distribution in environmental matrices, transport of compounds within and between matrices, abiotic and biotic transformations as well as environmental and human toxicity. In the lectures and exercises there will be special focus at identifying key substance properties and processes and at discussing how these affect the fate, exposure and effects of the specific chemicals. Some of the lectures will be given by experts with active research on the specific contaminant group.",
    "Course literature": "As teaching materials is used a \"Set of notes\" composed by teachers own notes supplemented with relevant literature.",
    "Remarks": "The course complements the course 12237 “Chemicals in the environment”, and is intended to provide a deeper and broader understanding of key processes and key pollutants within the area of environmental organic chemistry.",
