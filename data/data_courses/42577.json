    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nBusiness Analytics is about exploring and analysing data to gain insight into past business performance in order to guide future business planning.\n\nThis course introduces the portfolio of data science tasks and techniques necessary for exploring, manipulating, visualizing and analysing data (descriptive analytics), as well as for building prediction models using machine learning (predictive analytics) that can be used to gain insights and support decisions (prescriptive analytics). It is designed with Business Analytics students in mind (i.e. some Python programming background), particularly – but not exclusively - those related to studies on mobility and logistics and business analytics. Therefore, it contains a strong hands-on component, with specific real-world cases from mobility and business contexts.\n\nThe course also includes an introduction to data wrangling, problem formulation, and the basic suite of machine learning algorithms.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nRun Python scripts that load and analyses small/medium-sized datasets\nConvert a raw dataset into an actionable form to solve a concrete problem\nApply basic data structures and algorithms to manipulate data\nRelate available problems and data in a mobility/business analytics context with techniques to tackle them\nExtract and analyse insights from the application of methods for descriptive and predictive analytics\nVisualize and deconstruct complex temporal and spatial patterns\nCritically evaluate the results of a data sciences analysis and recommend actions from an operational point of view\nAppropriately train and test a statistical model to answer a problem\nExplain important data mining concepts, such as overfitting, bias, regularisation, etc",
    "Content": "The classes are taught in an interactive manner, with theoretical parts, intermingled with practice with Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nMain topics are: data visualisation, forecasting and regression models, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction and time-series. The methods will be exemplified through different cases within e.g. transportation, management and marketing.\n\nIntroduction to Python programming and Pandas is provided as supplementary material (requirement of the course/self learning)",
    "Course literature": "Each lecture has its own recommended texts, that will be available publicly online. For the student interested in a book to follow, we recommend \"The elements of statistical learning\", Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome H. Friedman \"Python for Data Analysis\", Wes McKinney",
