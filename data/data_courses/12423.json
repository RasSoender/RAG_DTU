    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course covers the fundamentals of constitutive laws for the representation of geomaterials, for prediction of the stability of geotechnical structures (foundations, tunnels, slopes, etc.).\n\nThe primary objective of this course is to provide students with a general background in soil/rock plasticity as an introduction to the broad area of inelastic response of geomaterials, as well as to provide the framework in which constitutive models are formulated and executed in numerical simulations.\n\nStudents who complete the course will be capable of formulating numerical models and analyse geotechnical problems with the use of numerical methods.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand how the general stress-strain response of the soil is represented mathematically.\nUnderstand how constitutive laws are implemented numerically.\nCalibrate parameters for various constitutive models.\nPredict stress strain response under given strain path and stress path conditions (drained and undrained).\nUnderstand the advantages and limitations of each constitutive framework and models, with respect to specific geotechnical problems.\nPredict the capacity for various geotechnical problems using numerical analysis.\nUtilize the mobilized strength design approach.\nReport and synthesize the results of numerical analysis",
