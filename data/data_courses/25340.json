    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course will provide the students with a basic knowledge of how to find, extract, handle and analyze oceanographic data from diverse platforms, instruments and databases.\n\nThis is a skill that is relevant in all disciplines of ocean engineering, from planning and monitoring commercial activities to analyzing and understanding oceanographic processes.\n\nThe course is structured as a combination of lectures with hands on exercises.\nLectures will provide basic knowledge on the data to be used (including principles, methodology, etc.) and description of the exercises and assignments to be performed.\n\nThe course will enable the students to work with oceanographic data products from a range of sources such as satellite remote sensing, reanalysis, model outputs, drifter/buoys, data repositories, atlas, etc.\n\nExercises will expose students to different data plotting and analyses tools, including Ocean Data View, and coding software such as Matlab, R or Python.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nList the types of ocean-related data products that are publicly available in data repositories.\nFind and retrieve data within these repositories for a specific application in marine sciences or ocean engineering.\nApply computer software to handle and extract large volumes of data.\nVisualize and analyze oceanographic data using modern software applications with interfaces (Ocean Data View).\nExplain how ocean data products are produced from models and observations.\nExplain advantages and limitations of different oceanography data sources.\nProduce diverse plots and maps to present data.\nConduct basic statistical analysis.\nAnalyze, interpret and visualize ocean data for a specific application.\nPrepare and present reports with summary of results.",
    "Content": "The course will present an introduction to the major types of oceanographic data that are freely available and the international programs (e.g., Copernicus, GLODAP) responsible for compiling and distributing oceanographic data. It will present the formats commonly used for oceanographic data, and the practical aspects of accessing these databases. Concepts of ocean model data products will be covered, including reanalysis, hindcast, forecasts, data assimilation, ensembles, observation postprocessing, data fusion, primitive equation models.\n\nSpecific topics to be covered include:\n• Processing and plotting data with Ocean Data View\n• Downloading, processing and plotting data with software that require coding\n• Processing and analysis of CTD data\n• Processing and analysis of Satellite remote sensing data\n• Processing and analysis of Earth System Model outputs\n• Processing and analysis of data from in situ sources (Drifters, buoys, ships of opportunity)\n\nThe course will be composed of two components. The first, a period of organized weekly learning sessions, and a group project that will last the entire duration of the course and represents 60% of the final grade.\n\nDuring the learning sessions, those will be organized as lectures and practical exercises. Class activities involve:\n• Lectures covering theoretical background.\n• Practical sessions in retrieving and handling data.\n• Exercises to analyze and visualize data.\n• Presentation and discussion to provide feedback from both peers and teacher.\n\nDuring the group project period, students will conduct group work on a specific topic. Specifically, students will explore an application relevant for their specific interests. Examples could include using Argo float observations to map variations in mixed layer depth in the Nordic Seas, or using ocean color satellite products to map changes in primary productivity to fisheries recruitment indices. Students will produce a written report on this group work. Reports will be presented and defended on the allocated exam date, thus constituting the oral exam, and will constitute 60% of the final grade.",
    "Remarks": "While the course will be offered primarily on Lyngby Campus, remote classroom attendance on the Hirtshals Campus will be made available if sufficient students choose this option.\n\nThis course provides students with competences relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #13 (Climate Action) and #14 (Life Below Water)",
