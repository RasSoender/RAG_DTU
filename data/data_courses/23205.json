    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nInfectious diseases are still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality around the world and cause a significant economical burden to society. Conventional strategies to fight infectious diseases, such as the use of antibiotics, are only partly effective and promote the spread of antibiotic resistance. Hence, novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of infectious disease are urgently needed.\nIn this course you will compare current and novel strategies to fight infectious diseases. You will gain insight into microbial adaptation mechanisms and how these can be identified and targeted using traditional and cutting-edge biomedical approaches. You will also gain insight into methods and tools for investigating the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and understanding the complex interactions between humans, animals and the environment. You will gain pratical experience in using whole genome sequencing (WGS) for simple tasks e.g., identification, typing and determination of resistance for pathogenic organisms, and you will learn how to analyse and interpret microbial WGS data in relation to clinical and food safety issues by using a number of web-based tools.\nFinally, you will be provided with training in the critical assessment of related scientific literature, and obtain an understanding of the individual steps of the scientific research process. You will learn to devise new innovative solutions to fight infectious diseases.\n=> See specific topics of the course content below.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the drivers of infectious diseases at the global and local level\nDiscuss state-of-the-art methods for preventing and controlling infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance\nAssess the benefits and risks of contemporary antimicrobial strategies on human health\nDevelop and assess strategies that contribute to the prevention and control of infectious diseases\nDiscuss approaches for prioritizing different intervention options\nExplain and discuss different techniques for whole genome sequencing and use data from these techniques to assemble draft genomes using web-based methods\nApply web-based bioinformatic methods to identify bacteria, sequence type, antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in whole genome data\nApply web-based methods for epidemiological investigations related to outbreaks caused by microorganisms and interpret the results in relation to identification of the route and source of infection\nGenerate new research questions and studies whose findings could facilitate the development of novel and more sustainable strategies to fight infectious diseases\nCritique scientific articles and communicate the results",
    "Content": "History of infectious diseases and means to combat them. The most common groups of infectious disease organism (vira, bacteria, parasites), their modes of transmission (e.g., airborne, vectorborne, foodborne) and risk factors. Methods for preventing, controlling and treating infections: prophylaxis, antimicrobials, immunization (vaccination and monoclonal antibodies), drug discovery, probiotics, bacteriophages, biosensors, antimicrobial peptides, hygiene, intervention (e.g., blocking transmission pathways). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) techniques and assembly. The bacterial species concept, antibiotics – mechanisms of action, mechanisms of resistance, virulence factors, horizontal gene transfer, phylogenetic trees, epidemiology; metagenomic data.",
    "Course literature": "All materials will be provided at the course. There is no specific text book, as the majority of knowledge that is the basis for this course originates from recent research. As a prerequisite about knowledge on pathogens and infectious diseases, we can recommend the book 'Medical Microbiology' by Barer, Irving, Swann, Perera, ISBN: 9780702072000.",
    "Remarks": "Students taking this course may also be interested in 27250. These two courses complement each other well, and you can follow them both. 23205 focusses on current & novel technologies for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, and 27250 focusses on the molecular basis of infections and technologies to studying host-pathogen interactions.",
