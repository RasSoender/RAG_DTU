    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose of the course is to give students with a theoretical IC engine background, the necessary experimental background to enable working with IC engines on a research and development level. The numerical treatment of acquired experimental data is considered as the major objective of the course. It is an important prerequisite for experimental projects with IC engines.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nList the measurements that are required to cover all major engine investigations.\nDistinguish confidently between the three most important IC engine principles.\nExplain how changes of engine parameters and fuel properties influence emissions and performance.\nCalculate an engine’s mean effective pressures and heat release curve based on measurements.\nCalculate the frequency spectrum of an engine’s combustion acoustics based on cylinder measurements.\nDetermine the different energy losses from an engine, based on measurements.\nNavigate independently in complex projects.\nCarry out data treatment of large experimental data sets in Matlab.\nCreate graphical illustrations of experimental results with multiple engine parameters varied.\nSelect an appropriate experimental method for a certain IC engine investigation.\nSelect which results that are relevant and should be included in a report.\nConsider uncertainties of the experimental results.",
    "Content": "Students will carry out classical as well as new IC engine experiments/investigations with compression ignition and spark ignition engines. The experiments will include measurement/control of engine speed, torque, cylinder pressure, friction, fuel and air consumption, ignition/injection timing, gaseous and particulate emissions. The particular experiments will to widest possible extend be part of current research activities on sustainable fuels and emission reduction.\n\nThe measurements enable students to characterize the engine performance in terms of traditional engine specifications like mean effective pressures, efficiencies, specific fuel consumption and specific emissions etc.\n\nIn group work the experimental data will be analyzed with Matlab. Graphical illustrations of the analysis and their interpretations, is the main subject in the report writing.\n\nCore elements:\n\n• Matlab programming\n• Programming with structured databases\n• Heat release analysis based on cylinder pressure\n• Spectral analysis of cylinder pressure with FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)\n• Digital signal filtering\n• Investigate and interpret results from variation of engine parameters\n• Graphical presentation of results",
