    "Content": "Partial differential equations (PDE) on weak form. Implementation of PDEs in the finite-element-method software Comsol Multiphysics. Numerical convergence analysis. Governing equations for scalar and vector fields in mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, elektrokinetics, acoustics, and optics. Progression in the complexity of the problems from one scalar field, via one vector field, to coupled scalar and vector fields, as well as from 2D to 3D.",
