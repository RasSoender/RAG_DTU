    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nStructure-borne sound is the field of acoustics that deals with the generation and propagation of vibrations and forces in solid bodies and structures, as well as sound radiation of these structures. Vibration and wave motions in structures like beams and plates are essential.\n\nBy introducing the principles and laws governing the generation, transmission and radiation of structure-borne sound, it is the purpose of the course to enable the student to: a) analyse vibro-acoustic systems, e.g., technical noise and vibration problems, b) make practical proposals for reducing structure-borne noise in cabinets, machines, vehicles, buildings, etc., and c) apply advanced measurement techniques for verifying theoretical calculations.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the fundamental mechanisms and phenomena which generate vibration and sound waves in solid media and structures\nconduct calculations and analyses of the dynamic properties of simple resonant systems\nderive equation of motion for simple resonators and explain frequency responses and determination of damping properties, eg. from Nyquist diagram\nexplain/evaluate wave phenomena for longitudinal waves and bending wave fields in beams and rods and calculate vibrational responses\ndemonstrate the use of mobility methods for calculating response of built-up systems\nconduct and report on vibro-acoustic measurements, including applied signal analysis (spectral analysis, estimation of transfer functions, structural damping properties, etc.)\nexplain principle of vibration isolation and calculate insertion loss of simple vibration isolated sources\nexplain reasons for losses in structures and principles for added damping and calculate damping of single-layer viscoelastic vibration damping\nevaluate reflection and attenuation of structureborne waves in built-up systems, including periodic structures\nexplain and calculate wave fields and propagation of bending waves in plates\napply Statistical Energy Analysis and Matlab-based finite element analysis for calculating vibration in systems\nexplain and calculate sound radiation from compact simple sources and from plate-like structures, cabinets and cylinders",
    "Content": "Mechanisms for the generation of vibration and sound in structures. Simple resonators and models for damping mechanisms. Concepts of mobility and mechanical impedance. Vibro-acoustic measurement techniques. Introduction to applied signal analysis (spectral analysis, estimation of transfer functions, etc). The generation of vibration and sound waves in solids and structures (structureborne sound). Longitudinal waves and bending waves in beams and plates. Analytical and statistical methods for calculating structureborne sound and transmission in complex structures. Vibration isolation, attenuation and damping of structureborne sound in equipment and machinery. Sound radiation from vibrating structures (plates, cylinders, cabinets, etc). Control and damping of vibration and sound radiation. Principles for altering the transmission and radiation properties of structures.",
    "Remarks": "The course is aimed at students who, having followed a basic course in acoustics, wish for a more advanced understanding of sound and vibration, its generation, propagation and attenuation. The course is a natural introduction to a master thesis work in Acoustic Technology and/or CAMM â€“ Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Microsystems. It is good to have taken 31240 and 31260 beforehand.\n\nE-learning is used in the form of video streamed podcast lectures, quizzes etc.",
