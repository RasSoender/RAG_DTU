    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the physical principles and intended function of various underwater acoustic and optical instruments\nDescribe the operations with various acoustic and optical imaging instruments including calibration, operation at sea, data processing and visualization.\nImplement MATLAB & python based programs for the processing and analysis of optical and acoustic data on local and cluster-based hardware.\nSelect appropriate and effective acoustic or optical imaging solutions based on engineering and science objectives.\nAssess the comparative advantages / disadvantages of optical and acoustic sensing.\nExplain the basic operating principles of underwater acoustic sensing: Active / passive acoustic sensing; Phase arrays and beam forming; Target strength and backscattering volume strength; Single-, Split- and Multi-beam transducers; Continuous and wideband wave types.\nExplain the principles of underwater optical sensing: Image geometry, Lens distortion, Color shift, Mono-, stereo-, and multi-camera systems, Lighting considerations, Active optical sensing.\nEvaluate the tradeoffs in operating with various underwater navigation solutions that use acoustic and optical technologies.\nPlan, develop and execute methods for underwater acoustic and optical data collection and processing to address engineering challenges in a formative project.\nPresent the methods and the results of the project orally and in writing.",
    "Content": "In this course, students will learn the fundamental principles of acoustic and optical sensing for operational oceanography, with a focus on their application in aquatic environments for both engineering and scientific goals. The integration of acoustic and optical sensing provides a comprehensive view of the ocean environment, enabling oceanographers to better map, understand and predict changes in the ocean's physical and biological systems.\n\nThrough this course, students will gain knowledge about various types of acoustic and optical sensors that are used for obtaining images of the water column and seabed, supporting navigation of underwater crafts, and enabling communication between underwater devices. They will also learn how to acquire, process, and visualize acoustic and optical data through hands-on activities in the laboratory.\n\nWorking in groups, students will conceive, design, and operate acoustic and optical data collection solutions to solve relevant engineering and scientific challenges. They will also learn how to effectively use those acoustic and optical instruments in real world applications. By the end of this course, students will have gained practical experience and a thorough understanding of acoustic and optical sensing, which are critical tools for operational oceanography.",
