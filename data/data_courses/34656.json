    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the student to conduct a complete design of integrated analog circuitry from a given specification through schematic design and analysis to a layout ready for manufacturing.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSynthesize an operational amplifier according to a certain specification in a CMOS process\nUse a schematic editor and a simulation environment for design and analysis of analog circuitry\nAnalyze the performance of the design circuit in all process corners\nCorrelate simulated results with calculated values based on a small signal equivalent of the operational amplifier\nUse a layout editor for making layout of analog circuitry\nIdentify the parts of the design critical to matching and make layout that ensures good matching for these parts\nUse a DRC tool (Design Rule Checking) to ensure the design fulfills the design rules\nUse a LVS tool (Layout Versus Schematic) to ensure the layout matches the schematic design\nDesign a simple padring for the design at schematic level\nDocument the work in a final report",
    "Content": "The course is conducted as a project where the students work in groups. During the project status and review meeting will be held where the students exchange experiences and help each other with various challenges and problems. During the project lectures will be given in selected topics.\n\nThe course treats analog circuits, schematic design, layout, computer simulations (DC; AC, transient), design rule check (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS)",
