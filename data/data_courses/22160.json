    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nGeneral competence course (MSc), Bioinformatics and Systems Biology\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Bioinformatics",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E3A (Tues 8-12)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "Semi-flipped classroom. Students prepare assigned written and video based materials before class. Classes are initiated by a brief summary of key points from last week's exercises followed by a brief introduction to key points of the topic of the day. The remainder of the class is Cloud based exercises. Students are required to bring their own laptop with functioning wireless internet and a valid DTU account.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E3A",
    "Type of assessment": "Written examination and exercises\nThe exam consists of 3 sub-tests: 1. A code-based group project. 2. An oral group presentation of the project. 3. 2 hour final individual MCQ exam. All three sub-tests must be completed in order to pass the course. The final grade is based on an overall assessment of all three sub-tests. Notes for partial tests: 1. All members are responsible for all parts of the project. 2. All members must present physically on the last day of classes. 3. General course learning objectives are examined. The re-examination will consist of independent preparation of a new project according to the same guidelines as during the ordinary exam, followed by an oral presentation, where the general course learning objectives are also examined. No supervision is provided in this regard. There is no final MCQ exam.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of this course is to equip students with practical skills in modern bio data science using Tidyverse R, RStudio IDE, and the Quarto reporting system. Throughout the course, students will learn how to transform messy data sets into clean and organized ones, perform data analysis, gain insights through exploratory data analysis, and communicate results via data visualization and dynamic reporting. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of reproducible data analysis and designing, organizing and executing collaborative bio data science projects using Tidyverse R and git/GitHub. The course will exclusively focus on biological data sets.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain why reproducible data analysis is important and the difference between replicability and reproducibility.\ndescribe the basic concepts of data cleaning and transformation and how they relate to reproducible data analysis.\nexplain which Tidyverse tools do what and correctly identify appropriate tools for given tasks.\napply Tidyverse tools to convert a messy data set into a clean and consistent one in context with exploratory data analysis and gain insights into biological data.\nuse RStudio and git/GitHub to collaborate on bio data science projects.\nperform basic statistical tests and linear models using Tidyverse framework.\ncreate a simple R package.\ncreate a simple Shiny app.\nindependently identify and adapt relevant novel state-of-the-art data science tools.\nuse Large-Language-Model (LLM) technology such as chatGPT as a sparring-partner in a Bio Data Science project and assess the potential pitfalls and impact hereof.\ndesign and organize a collaborative end-to-end bio data science project using Tidyverse R and git/GitHub and present the results in a comprehensive dynamic Quarto report/presentation.\nanalyze an already performed Bio Data Science project to assess the choice of methods, reproducibility, and quality of data communication.",
    "Content": "Modern bio data science in Tidyverse R, data -cleaning, -wrangling, -visualisation and -communication. Tidyverse R, RStudio, Quarto, dplyr, ggplot, reproducible bio data analysis, rstudio.cloud, shinyapps.io, R-packages, git/GitHub, bio data science project organisation all with an applied focus. Some elements of applied basic statistics and machine learning.",
    "Course literature": "The teaching will largely follow \"R for Data Science (2e)\" by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund [1], but also other open source learning materials will be used.
