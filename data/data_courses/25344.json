    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to introduce the students to various effects of shipping and offshore activities on marine environment, as well as to their potential regulatory, technological and operational solutions. The focus is both on the ‘old problems’, such as operational chemical discharges and accidental spills (e.g., scrubber discharge water, chemical and oil spills), spread of non-indigenous species, noise, light and physical effects (e.g., erosion and ship strikes), and the new emerging questions related to e.g., the use of new fuels.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nGive an overview of environmental effects of maritime activities and how they are regulated.\nList different types of solutions to the environmental effects of maritime activities with examples from Danish shipping and/ or offshore sector.\nDescribe the fate and effect of diverse maritime contaminants in marine ecosystems, including dispersal, degradation, eco-toxicological effects and bioaccumulation.\nDescribe the cumulative effects of multiple maritime stressors, their interaction with climate change and the factors that contribute to the ecosystem resilience for the disturbance by maritime activities.\nFormulate a research question on a relevant aspect of environmental effects of maritime activities, based on a literature search and input from industry.\nDesign and conduct a laboratory, field or modelling experiment to address a relevant research question within maritime environment.\nEvaluate the findings of the laboratory, field or modelling study through comparison with existing literature and discussions during the course.\nDocument the procedures and results of the project by preparing a metadata description and recording of the data, and present the results as a poster.",
    "Content": "We consider dispersal, fate, ecological effects and potential bioaccumulation of contaminants, emphasizing the combined effects and interactions of diverse stressors, as well as the factors that contribute to the resilience of the ecosystems for disturbances, using case studies and examples from European and Arctic waters, as well as globally\nThe course consists of four elements:\n\n1) Introductory lectures on different types of environmental effects of the maritime activities and their potential interactions, as well as an overview of regulations and present-day solutions (or lack of them) to the problems.\n2) Guest lectures and potentially excursions by maritime industry, regulatory authorities and / or other experts presenting the current challenges within maritime environmental issues.\n3) Hands-on group work including a laboratory experiment, field sampling and sample analysis or a modelling exercise on an environmental effect of a relevant maritime activity and a documentation of the results (in a form of data log and metadata description).\n4) Poster presentation of the group work.\nThe course will be organized around weekly lectures and guest lectures of ca. 2 h, as well as independent project work that will be conducted with the help from supervisors assigned to each group. All groups will need to prepare a metadata description for their results, as well as a record of the data. The final class will consist of poster presentations by each project group.\n\nThe course addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 ‘Life below water’, particularly its targets to prevent and reduce marine pollution (14.1) and to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems (14.2).",
