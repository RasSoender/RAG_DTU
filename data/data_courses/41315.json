    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nderive a finite-volume discretisation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\nderive first and second order spatial discretization schemes\nderive a pressure equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation (the SIMPLE algorithm)\nderive first and second order explicit and implicit time integration schemes\ncreate meshes using the STAR-CCM+\nanalyze and select proper physical and numerical boundary conditions\nanalyze and select appropriate physical models\nselect an appropriate time step size based on Courant and Fourier stability limits\nproduce flow visualisations using STAR-CCM+",
    "Content": "The course gives an introduction to the governing Navier-Stokes equations and their solution using the finite-volume method. The course presents solution procedures for the velocity-pressure coupling for explicit and implicit time discretization schemes. Direct and iterative solution procedures for the linearized equations are discussed. The focus of the course is application of the commercial CFD package: STAR-CCM+ for practical problems in fluid mechanics.\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the numerical analysis of fluid motion, heat transfer and associated phenomena. It involves the formulation of the governing partial diffential equations describing the transport of mass, momentum and heat, and a discretiation of these equations using finite-difference, finite-volume or finite-element methods.\nFor engineering applications the finite volume discretization is often method of choice as it allows simulations of fluid flow in complex geometries with a minimum requirement of computer memory and execution time. The course will outline the steps required for the spatial and temporal discretization of the governing equations using finite-volumes and describe techniques for the solution of the discrete set of equations.\nThe participants may bring their own (STAR-CCM+) flow problem for the exercises in the 3rd week of the course.",
