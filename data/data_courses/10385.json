    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles and physical underpinnings of quantum computing, communication and sensing. Through this course, students will also gain experience in designing, implementing and operating quantum devices, algorithms, and protocols. In addition, the course aims to foster a critical and analytical approach to evaluating the performance and potential of quantum technologies, both in terms of their theoretical capabilities and practical limitations. Ultimately, the goal of this course is to provide students with a strong foundation for further studies in quantum information technology, as well as to prepare them for careers in academia and industry, where expertise in this field is increasingly in demand.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand key concepts of quantum information including entanglement, quantum measurements, quantum circuits, and measurement-based quantum computing.\nAnalyse simple photonic circuits and explain how quantum computing can be realised using light.\nExplain how quantum resource states can be engineered with optics and solid-state emitters.\nUnderstand the basic concepts of quantum metrology, including precision scaling.\nUnderstand how to sense physical quantities, e.g. optical phases and magnetic fields using e.g. optical and color-center setups.\nDesign and analyse quantum sensing schemes.\nExplain central challenges and concepts in quantum communication, including quantum teleportation, quantum repeaters, and quantum cryptography.\nAnalyse schemes for quantum cryptography and quantum random number generation based on continuous degrees of freedom of light.",
    "Content": "This course covers a wide range of cutting-edge sensing, communication, and computing technologies that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics. The course content will start by introducing the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and then move on to discuss specialized protocols and techniques such as quantum magnetometry, phase estimation, quantum cryptography, quantum repeaters, boson sampling, and quantum information processing. Through lectures and hands-on projects, students will gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and testing these quantum technologies. They will also learn how to analyze and optimize the performance of these systems using state-of-the-art methods for quantum error correction, fault tolerance, and quantum simulation. The course content is designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the potential applications and limitations of quantum information technology in various fields, including materials science, biology, finance, and cybersecurity. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to pursue further studies in this rapidly evolving and exciting field.",
