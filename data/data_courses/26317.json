    "Content": "Virtually everybody in chemistry and biochemistry is working with various analytical methods that are applied to production, quality control and research. Many important decisions in the society are executed on the basis of results of chemical analysis. Examples comprise additives to food products, drinking water, waste water, quality of pharmaceuticals, nutrients and forensics. Process control constitute another areas of research, where chemical analysis and biochemical analysis are important.\nA wide variety of technologies are treated at the course, such as sample preparation, spectrometric technologies and automatic technologies. A introduction is given to chromatography comprising gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The separation technologies are hyphenated with detectors, such as mass spectrometers, photo multipliers (diode array), electrodes and light scattering. Measurements by other spectrometric methods and analysis by biosensors also has widespread application.\nInorganic chemistry:\nThe subjects include ISE, coulometry, stripping analysis, optical methods, turbidimetry, ICP-AES and ICP-MS. Automatic methods.\nOrganic chemistry: Methods for the separation and characterization of organic molecules including characterization of polymers",
