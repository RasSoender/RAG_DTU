    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide a more advanced understanding of the electronic structure of solid state and nanostructured systems with emphasis on the phenomena which require a description beyond the single-particle approximation and which are important for understanding e.g. excited states and solid materials interaction with light. The course will enable the student to read the modern litterature and undertake smaller research projects in the field.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine and discuss the concept of the density response function of a system of interacting electrons and its relation to the elementary electronic excitations in the system.\nFormulate and derive the analytic properties of general response functions including the Kramer-Kronig relations between the real- and imaginary parts.\nDiscuss and characterize the various types of elementary electronic excitations in a solid state system including collective excitations, bound electron-hole, and single-particle excitations.\nExplain the key features of the density response function of the homogeneous electron gas.\nDescribe the connection between the microscopic dielectric function and the density response function.\nRelate the microscopic dielectric function to the macroscopic optical constants of a solid such as the absorption coefficient and reflectivity, and discuss the role of local field effect.\nDefine the single-particle Green function and the self-energy, and discuss its relation to the band structure of a solid.\nDiscuss the GW approximation as a method to obtain the band structure\nDiscuss the Bethe-Salpeter equation as a method to calculate optical excitations\nExplain the Hydrogenic model for calculating excitons\nExplain the Berry phase and relate it to topological insulators.",
    "Content": "The density response functions and its relation to the dielectric function. A quantum expression for the response function; static and dynamical screening within the random phase approximation (RPA); plasmons and plasmon-polaritons; electronic band structures and quasi-particles; the single-particle Green's functions and the concept of the self-energy; quasiparticle excitations and the GW approximation and the quasiparticle equation; excitons and the Bethe-Salpeter equation for optical excitations; Berry's phase, topological insulators.",
