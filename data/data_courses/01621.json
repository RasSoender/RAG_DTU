    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course covers theory and techniques used for studying and solving global problems occurring in nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Whereas focus in introductory level dynamical systems courses, see e.g. 01617, is on local phenomena near equilibria, attention in this course will be on global phenomena (such as limit cycles and heteroclinics/homoclinic connections). Topics will include global bifurcations, Melnikov theory and horseshoe maps, Poincaré maps, singular perturbation theory, Poincaré compactification, and blowup techniques. The theory will be applied to equations arising in the applied sciences.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCombine local, global and singular perturbation theory to construct phase portraits.\nStudy global bifurcations in planar systems\nConstruct simple proofs within the theory of dynamical systems\nAnalyze global problems using transit mappings and the implicit function theorem\nAnalyze perturbations of homoclinics/heteroclinics using Melnikov theory\nApply Poincaré compactification to study global phase portraits of planar system\nAnalyze singular perturbed problems using Fenichel's theory\nApply blowup techniques to study nonhyperbolic equilibria",
    "Content": "Global bifurcations, Melnikov theory and horseshoes, compactification, singular perturbation theory, blowup",
    "Remarks": "The course can be followed in parallel with 01622.",
