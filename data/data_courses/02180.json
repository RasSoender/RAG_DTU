    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim is to provide the student with an understanding of basic notions and techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) and to train the student’s abilities to apply these techniques. The focus of the course is primarily on symbolic artificial intelligence, in particular techniques based on search and logic.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain, apply and implement uninformed and informed search techniques to solve AI problems\nExplain, apply and implement adversarial search techniques for AI in games\nDesign, implement, benchmark and analyse search heuristics and game evaluation functions\nExplain and apply logical techniques for the representation of knowledge and reasoning\nExplain, apply and implement inference techniques in propositional and first-order logic\nExplain the logical methods of knowledge-base update\nExplain the strength and weaknesses of different AI techniques within search and logic\nCorrectly determine the relevant AI technique for solving a given problem\nExplain the scope of AI, its potential for society as well as its limitations\nDiscuss philosophical, ethical, legal, and societal consequences of AI",
    "Content": "What is AI? Foundations of AI. Uninformed search. Informed/heuristic search: A*, greedy best-first search. Adversarial search: game trees, Minimax, Monte-Carlo Tree Search. Knowledge bases in propositional and first-order logic. Inference techniques in propositional and first-order logic: modus ponens, forward and backward chaining, resolution, model-checking, SAT-solving. Basic strategies for updating knowledge bases (belief revision). Philosophical, ethical, legal and societal aspects of AI.",
