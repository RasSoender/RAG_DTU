    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe general objective of the course is to provide in-depth knowledge regarding advanced optimization methods for public transport planning, vehicle routing and distribution planning, and maritime logistics. Participants will be able to identify problems in these different application fields, formulate mathematical programming models for these, and solve them using advance operations research methods, both exact and heuristics.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUse the most important models in transport optimization\nDescribe the most important solution methods in transport planning\nAnalyze similarities and differences for transport planning models in the fields of public transport, vehicle routing, and maritime logistics\nSolve transport optimization models using a mathematical programming language\nDesign solution algorithms for transport optimization problems using the most important solution methods in transport optimization\nConstruct and implement a column generation framework for a well defined optimization problem in transport optimization, analyze its outcomes, and appraise benefits and disbenefits of this approach versus heuristic approaches.\nDifferentiate between deterministic and stochastic transport planning problems\nDesign and implement solution methods for deterministic and stochastic transport planning problems, and analyze their outcomes\nImplement solution methods for deterministic and stochastic transport planning problems\nInvestigate the state-of-the-art mathematical models of transport planning\nWrite clear and well-structured reports documenting the modeling and findings of an implemented solution approach\nArgue about the value of transport optimization in a sustainability context",
    "Content": "This is an advanced course focused on analyzing, formulating and implementing mathematical optimization models for resource planning and scheduling in the area of transportation. It covers applications in the area of public transport planning, maritime logistics, and vehicle routing. Exact topics may change per year, but could include: Timetabling, Crew planning, Network design, Revenue Management, Aircraft Rotation, Pick-up and Delivery Problems, Dial-a-Ride Problems, Container terminal planning and Berth allocation. The course will combine basic domain knowledge in these three fields, with the application of OR methods to solve problems within these fields.\n\nImportant prerequisites are an understanding of, and experience with, integer linear programming models. The course is best suited as a second-semester or third-semester course. The course will offer real life examples from public transport, vehicle routing, and maritime logistics. The course assignments will give the participants the opportunity to develop models for different transportation problems and to solve them using modelling and optimization tools (e.g. CPLEX and Julia).",
    "Remarks": "The course requires a good knowledge of operations research i.e. the prerequisites, or similar, are to be taken seriously. Knowledge of CPLEX and JULIA (or similar) is not necessary and will be introduced at the start of the course, but basic programming skills are a prerequisite. The course is a merger of the courses 42881/13251 Optimisation in Public Transport, 42887/13442 Vehicle Routing and Distribution Planning, and 42885/13432 Maritime Logistics, and thereby covers a wide spectrum within the field of operations research as a planning tool in the transportation sector.",
