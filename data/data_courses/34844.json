    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe goal of the course is to provide the participants with knowledge about the effects of noise on human beings, the principles of noise control in buildings and in the environment, and the room acoustic requirements that must be fulfilled in a typical building design project.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the fundamental acoustic concepts such as the sound pressure, sound power, sound energy density, sound intensity\ndescribe fundamental properties of hearing and effects of noise on human beings\nexplain how sound is measured, describe the decibel scale, A-weighted levels, and octave and one-third octave bands\nexplain the influence of wind and temperature gradients on outdoor sound propagation and the effect of noise barriers\ncalculate the attenuation of sound with distance in a free field and in a room\ninterpret resonances and modes in a room\ncalculate the reverberation time in a room\ndescribe the sound absorptions properties of porous absorbers, panel absorbers, and resonant absorbers\ncalculate the sound insulation of single and double constructions, and describe the critical frequency and the resonance frequency of a double construction\ndescribe and calculate resonance frequency and the attenuation by a simple vibration isolator\ndescribe and calculate the sound attenuation through a ventilation duct\nlist the basic principles for good acoustical design of rooms",
    "Content": "Basic acoustic concepts. Noise effects on human beings. Measurement of sound and noise rating methods. Outdoor sound propagation. Traffic noise. Noise barriers. Room acoustics and reverberation time. Sound absorbing materials. Airborne sound and impact sound insulation. Vibrations and noise from building services.
