    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give basic understanding of the power system and the essential aspects having influence on issues like the future electrical power system.\nThe students achieve knowledge about the power grid and the main components involved under production, transmission and distribution of electric energy. The main principles and numerical tools for grid calculations are treated and will give experience and confidence for use hereof.\nThe course forms the base for further education within power engineering, but is in general useful for all students aiming at some specialization within electrical energy systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify differences between a simple electric circuit and a three-phase power system\nExplain the structure of a power system\nDescribe power system components and explain their functions\nSelect appropriate models for power system components\nCalculate power system quantities by means of the per-unit system\nDetermine operational limitis in a power system\nCalculate balanced three-phase short circuit currents\nExplain the power flow problem and approaches to solve it\nSummarize operation principles of a power system in terms of control of voltage, active and reactive power\nDesign a realistic power system\nEvaluate the overall performance of a power system under different operating scenarios by means of a power flow program",
    "Content": "- Power grid\n- AC circuits, 3-phase systems, power considerations\n- Components in the grid like transmission lines, cables, transformers, generators and more.\n- Power flows and tools for simulation\n- Symmetrical faults\n\nThe topics from the text book can be supported by topics from related areas.\n\nIn the project, a realistic problem will be defined and has to be solved by means of the numerical simulation program PowerFactory (load flow) with graphical user interface.",
