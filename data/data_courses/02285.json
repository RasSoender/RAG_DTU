    "Schedule": "Spring F4A (Tues 13-17)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "Lectures, exercises, assignments and a large programming project.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "F4A",
    "Type of assessment": "Evaluation of exercises/reports\nThe assessment is based on 2 assignments during the course and a large final programming project. The final programming project is a group project, and the 2 other assignments will be either individual or group work. All group assignments are required to be individualised (stating exactly who did what). The course is evaluated as a whole.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course introduces students to advanced techniques within artificial intelligence (AI), with particular focus on automated planning and multi-agent systems. The objective of the course is to become able to explain, analyse and implement advanced AI techniques.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe a number of the most prevalent techniques in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems - both in overall terms and on a detailed technical level\ncompare and assess the appropriateness of various AI techniques within automated planning and multi-agent systems for solving a given concrete problem\ncombine different AI techniques in a theoretically sound and practically useful way\napply a given AI technique to a given concrete problem\nclarify the general complications and pitfalls involved in practical uses of AI techniques\nindependently explore the literature relevant to a specific AI project within automated planning and multi-agent systems\nimplement non-trivial AI techniques in a relatively large software system\ncommunicate results within the areas of the course in the style of a research conference contribution",
    "Content": "The course primarily focuses on topics within automated planning and multi-agent systems, but will also address other areas of AI (e.g. problem-solving by searching, knowledge representation and reasoning with logical agents).\n\nThe programming project concerns the design and implementation of advanced AI techniques in a simulated multiagent environment. The programming project is very open-ended and invites for the development of your own algorithms and multiagent architectures. The project is carried out in groups, and should result in a working system and a video in which you present the system and its underlying ideas in the style of research presentations at AI conferences.\n\nIn addition to the programming project there will be 2 smaller assignments during the course.",
