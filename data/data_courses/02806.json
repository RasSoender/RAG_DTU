    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course objective is to enable the students to create visualizations of complex data sets and to apply common strategies for understanding the content of media (e.g. text, music, images, etc).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAccess and assess types of available on-line data for data visualization.\nUse state-of-the-art tools to filter, clean, and organize large, complex datasets\nApply standard tools from high-level programming languages (e.g. Python, MatLab, R) to evaluate data visualization methods for exploration of single variable data, including dot and jitter plots, histograms, kernel density estimates, distribution functions, and more.\nAssess and apply data visualization methods for data exploration of multiple variable data, including estimating functional relationships (e.g. by smoothing noise, visualizing residuals, using log, semilog-plots, and simple regressions).\nUse visualization techniques to evaluate and identify limitations of summary statistics, based e.g. on Simpson’s paradox, and Anscombe’s quartet.\nUse basic principles of displaying visual information (e.g. Tufte’s six principles of graphical integrity) to create explanatory visualizations.\nApply specialized visualization software (e.g. JavaScrip’s D3 library or Python libraries) in order to build custom visualizations designed to explain insights from a dataset to an audience.\nAnalyze cases of narrative data visualization to extract the underlying principles used to construct this type of visualization.\nBuild a narrative data-visualization.",
    "Content": "The course is based on mastering tools for analyzing data sets generated from online social interactions. The course is structured around short lectures combined with exercises, as well as a high degree of independent project work",
