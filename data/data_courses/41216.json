    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the students to understand and to use modern rational methods within the strength of materials and reliability theory to design ships.\n\nTo enable students to do quality assurance of an engineering project.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nComprehend the fundamentals of structural design and assessment of ships\nComprehend the fundamentals of modeling of ocean waves\nApply methods that account for the statistical nature of ocean waves\nDetermine wave-induced loads on the ship in stochastic sea\nDetermine extreme wave loads on the ship\nDetermine the expected fatigue damage in the hull\nDetermine hull girder stresses due to static and dynamic loads\nAssess the safety against the failure of the hull girder under specified loading\nUnderstand loads due to hull girder vibrations\nUnderstand safety factors for rule development\nAssess the safety of a vessel after collision or grounding\nWrite a technical report for a specific ship dealing with bullets mentioned above",
    "Content": "The main emphasis is on the determination of the global response of a given ship sailing in waves. Safety against global failure of the hull girder should be evaluated under normal operation conditions. Accidental loads (collision and grounding) will also be covered as well as rational rule development.\n\nBending moment, sagging, hogging.\nOcean waves: linear and non-linear wave elevation, regular and irregular waves, excitation wave spectrum, stationary process, wave scatter diagram.\nStresses in the hull girder: midship section, effective thickness, section modulus, maximum normal stress, yield stress. Statistical short-term and long-term analyses, extreme values, expected fatigue damage.\nHull vibrations: hull flexibility, the natural frequency of the hull, springing, whipping.\nReliability analysis of the hull girder: Hasofer-Lind safety index, probability of failure, limit state function.",
