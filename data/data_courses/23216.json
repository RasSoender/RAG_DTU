    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall aim of this course is to give a theoretical background within production of food ingredients with a specific focus on adding value to raw materials and waste/side streams for production of new food ingredients and supplements in a sustainable manner. Cases will be used as illustrations of applied tehcnologies, production and utilization concepts. The aim is also to give an introductory background on the quality and functionality of the ingredients and their utilization.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain, compare and justify processes and technologies used for production of food ingredients based on cost benefit and energy calculations\nDiscuss how new ingredients can be produced, utilized and create value from raw materials and waste/side streams from food industries in a sustainable manner\nDescribe the quality parameters and functionalities of the different categories of food ingredients\nCreate theoretical concepts for practical challenges of (multi-)extraction of the different raw materials described in the lectures by identifying, validating and applying the theoretical knowledge\nIdentify and define the most suitable process, case by case\nJustify and evaluate principles of processes across different cases\nDemonstrate innovative problem solving and solutions\nProduce and structure concise posters to be pitched in plenum\nEvaluate and give constructive feedback to posters and pitches from other course participants",
    "Content": "The student will in the learning process understand and theoretically apply processes (e.g. enzymatically, liquid-liquid and solid-liquid extraction, filtering, drying etc.) to different raw materials/biomasses in order to obtain different new ingredients of higher value such as proteins, polysaccharides, pigments, vitamins and polyphenols. The sustainability of the technologies used will be justified through calculations of e.g. water and energy use. The raw materials and wastes are case studies such as algae, fish side streams, potato waste. Furthermore, the students will briefly learn about the functions of the ingredients such as emulsifiers, antioxidants, colouring agents etc.\nThe teaching will be a mix of aqusition through just in time teaching (f.x. e-learning), team work inquiry and collaboration for the production of hand in posters for each case, student presentations and discussions, in order to form future food engineers with innovative problem solving and solution skills. Evaluation will be based on the ability to discuss and argue for the choices of technologies for the problem solving and solutions.",
