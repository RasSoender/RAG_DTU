    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the student insight into the physics behind different sustainable energy technologies for energy harvesting, storage and conversion, and their limitations determined by the laws of nature.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the possible sources of sustainable energy and analyze the amount of energy available in them\nDescribe the climate models and identify the assumptions behind\nExplain the principles behind different energy harvesting methods\nEvaluate different methods for energy storage and conversion and explain the principles behind them\nEstimate and calculate the limitations of e.g. storage capacity and energy conversion efficiency based on physical principles\nTake a project related to sustainable energy and determine the relevant data for the analysis and present this to the class.\nIdentify challenges and strategies for the decarbonization of important economic sectors beyond energy and transport.\nUnderstand the key principles behind CO2 capture techniques\nAnalyze the link between different energy harvesting and storage methods. The student should be able to determine in which situations different methods are working together and in which situations they are competitive",
    "Content": "The course will provide an overview of the energy situation, energy sources and demand. It will go into detail with solar spectrum, climate, harvesting of solar energy, photosynthesis, CO2 capture, fuel/energy conversion and energy storage, and will provide insights into key challenges toward achieving a carbon-neutral society. For understanding the principles behind these topics we will apply elements of quantum mechanics, thermo dynamics, classical mechanics, material science, semi-conductor physics and surface science.",
