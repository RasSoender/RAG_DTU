    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims at qualifying the students to apply previously acquired basic knowledge in microbiology, biotechnology and process engineering to biological conversion of different kinds of biomass into biofuels by combining theoretical (lectures) and experimental (laboratory exercises) means. The focus will be on biomass availability, biofuels production processes and their feasibility. Obstacles and possible solutions for the technical implementation of biofuel production from different biomass resources will be analyzed too. The course will also include experimental project work and the students will be familiarized with the biomass-to-biofuel process through own obtained experimental data and calculations.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify the characteristics of biomass from different resources\nDescribe the different microbial processes for different biomass resources to produce specific biofuels\nDescribe a few of the existing industrial-scale facilities producing biofuels\nExplain the bottlenecks and/or inhibition effects for the different biomass-biofuel conversion processes\nUse the literature databases to find novel technologies within the field of biofuel production\nExplain the importance of sustainability issues in the production of biofuels from different biomass resources\nCalculate the theoretical potential for the different biomass resources to produce corresponding biofuels\nDesign innovative production processes for converting a given biomass resource into a specific biofuel",
    "Content": "The course deals with biological conversion of different biomass resources into biofuels such as methane, hydrogen, ethanol, butanol, biodiesel. Hybrid processes i.e. gasification and subsequent biological gas fermentation are also included in the course in the context of bio-based production of energy. The major elements of the course are: defining the concept of bioenergy production and sustainability, biomass characterization, mapping of biomass potential for biofuel production, microbial processes in relation to biofuels production, bottlenecks and inhibition effects and downstream processing. Examples from both research and industry will be presented in order to put the above concepts into perspective.\nThe course will provide the student with an overview of the biological processes that are used for conversion of biomass to biofuels. It focuses on fundamental biochemical concepts such as enzyme technology related to biomass composition and the use of enzymes for biomass degradation, thermodynamics and kinetics in relation to microbial growth and product formation and use of microorganisms for production of biofuels.\nThe course will also include experimental project work and the students will be familiarized with the biomass-to-biofuel process through own obtained experimental data and calculations. This will form the basis of a written report where the production process will be designed and discussed.",
    "Remarks": "Dedication and commitment to own learning as well as to group work, is expected from the course participants.\nAttendance to guest lectures (3-4) and excursion to a biogas plant are compulsory elements for this course.",
