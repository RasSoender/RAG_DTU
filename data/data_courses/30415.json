    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce RF communication circuits, their design concepts in discrete or integrated realizations, and the trade-off between circuit technology and communication systems requirements. The student will be able to design RF communication circuits or subsystems based on component, circuit, and system data and specifications.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain principles of the most common radio transmitter and receiver systems\ndesign frequency selective networks using narrow band approximations and series-to-parallel conversions\nconstruct RF impedance matching and transformation circuits using discrete components\ndesign stable small-signal RF amplifiers\ncalculate noise-figure and dynamic ranges of amplifiers from component data\nexplain basic RF power amplifier principles and conduct simple design calculations\ndesign simple RF-oscillators using LC and crystal resonators\nexplain mixer principles and conduct basic design calculations.",
    "Content": "RF signals and circuits, including linear amplifiers, mixers, oscillators, detectors, limiters, and power amplifiers. Transmitter and receiver structures. Design of RF integrated circuits. Circuit concepts like stability, noise, distortion, intermodulation, and dynamic range. System concepts including signal to noise ratio, thresholds, and bit error rates. Circuits, which are used in Bluetooth, WiFi, Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communications, Connected Cars, radars, medical and biomedical instruments and many others.",
