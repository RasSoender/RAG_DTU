    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nHealth technology is defined by the World Health Organization as the \"application of organized knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures, and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives\".\n\nThe overall aim of the course is to provide an overview and understanding of where and how physics is applied in Health Technology.\n\nHealth Technology involves a wide range of both classical and modern physics: mechanics (collisions and waves), thermodynamics,  electromagnetism (photonics), electrodynamics, relativity, quantum mechanics, atomic physics, solid state physics and nuclear physics.\n\nTopics covered include magnetic resonance, ultrasound, optical sensing and imaging technology, as well as ionizing radiation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nextract analyte concentration from optical absorption data.\ndetermine particle size distribution from diffusion and optical scattering data.\nselect suitable, optics-based based method to extract information about specificity, concentation and size distribution of analyte in liquid solution.\ncalculate the evolution for coupled spin systems during magnetic resonance (MR) sequences.\nderive the dependence of MR relaxation times on nuclear mobility.\nexplain the Overhauser effect and its applications for hyperpolarized MR.\nexplain ultrasound propagation and scattering.\nexplain properties of ultrasound fields.\ndesign ultrasound arrays for high quality imaging.\nexplain the main type of interactions for photons, neutrons, electrons and protons.\nexplain the concept of kerma, absorbed dose and charge particle equilibrium.\ncompute the absorbed dose from given particle fluence.",
    "Content": "The course gives an introduction to selected applications of physics in Health Technology:\n(1) Optical techniques in the life-science lab. (2) Ionising radiation. (3) Magnetic resonance imaging. (4) Ultrasound imaging.",
