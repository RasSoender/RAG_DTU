    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nEmpowering the student from developing software on a personal computer to designing and implementing life science projects on super computers.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nimprove performance of a program by applying acquired knowledge of how a PC and a supercomputer works from a hardware perspective (similarities and differences).\ndesign programs and pipelines which use a queuing system efficiently in various ways.\nevaluate the efficiency of a program or pipeline by analyzing the use of IO and memory.\nimplement trivial parallel program execution on a node/computer.\napply the 'Divide and Conquer' paradigm in a concrete case of Branch&Bound combinatoric optimization.\nevaluate if binary and/or probabilistic data structures can increase program performance and implement these data structures.\ndesign a database from real data and/or models.\nuse SQL to query and manipulate a database.\nprogram against a relational database in Python.\norganize a project such that the road from raw data to result is clear and reproducible.",
    "Content": "The course empowers the student from being the only user on a single computer to be one of many users on a supercomputer. This is done by lectures and exercises on topics such as computer architecture, queueing systems, parallel programming, algorithm design, program optimization, database design and application in theory and practice. Different life science cases are used in the teaching.",
    "Remarks": "The course uses the supercomputer 'Computerome 2' among others as a platform for the exercises.",
