    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to give students a basic general understanding\nof statistical models. The context is the general\nscientific method of confronting theoretical models\nwith measured observations. Important statistical principals\nare explained and exemplified among those are:\nData collection, estimation of model parameters, model\nselection, model validation, and quantification of uncertainties.\nExamples are selected to match model types\noften seen in natural resource management.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nClassify if a model is linear or nonlinear\nImplement linear and non-linear normal models via custom written likelihood code\nEstimate model parameters for linear and nonlinear normal models\nWrite models for different data types in clear text including model assumptions\nQuantify uncertainties of estimated model parameters and quantities of interest\nConstruct and interpret simple model diagnostics measures\nTest hypothesis and compare models\nPerform calculations needed in R\nDocument the result of an analysis of data (model, estimates, uncertainties, and hypothesis testing)",
    "Content": "Statistics is a very broad discipline, but the part of\nstatistics that will be the subject of this introductory\ncourse is practical statistical data analysis. The\ngoal is to present a coherent common-sense approach\nto drawing conclusions from observing nature. The approach\nshould end up producing 1) correct estimates of\nquantities of interest, 2) correct quantification of uncertainties,\nand 3) correct conclusions w.r.t. relevant\nhypothesis. That’s it.\nIt may sound simple to interpret measured information,\nand sometimes it is — if measurements are originating\nfrom a tightly controlled lab experiment, but the very\nprocess of measuring nature may present challenges that\nneeds to be accounted for. The challenges can be caused\nby what is practically possible. It may be impossible to\nobtain measurements which are representative (e.g. if\npart of the area or population is inaccessible), or it may\nbe impossible to directly measure the quantity of interest\n(e.g. the number of fish alive), but possible to measure\nsome related quantity (e.g. number of caught fish). The\nchallenges can also be caused by non-linear behavior of\nthe system beeing measured.\nThis course gives an introduction to the basic steps that\nneeds to be undertaken. The theory is demonstrated,\nexamplified, and practiced via examples taken mainly\nfrom natural resource management.",
