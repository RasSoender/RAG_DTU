    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo understand the fundamental physics and technology of ultrafast lasers and gain an appreciation of how they are enabling cutting-edge basic science and having a disruptive impact on specific industrial applications with high commercial potential. Specifically, the course considers how ultrafast pulses are generated, how they propagate, how we can measure them, their interaction with matter, and how they can be used to interrogate materials to reveal dynamic processes that evolve on natural time-scales equivalent to the motion of constituent electrons.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nRecall the operation of a continuous-wave laser and describe representations of ultra-short laser pulses and their key properties using mathematical classifications;\nExplain the principal of active mode-locking using a simplified framework to analyze the contribution of key components to the overall laser dynamics;\nShow how the interaction of ultra-short laser pulses with a purely dispersive medium can affect the pulse shape;\nApply a mathematical model to evaluate the properties of ultra-short laser pulses generated by a passively mode-locked laser;\nSketch designs and explain the operation limits of instruments that can measure ultra-short laser pulses;\nCreate a blueprint for an ultrafast laser system and argue how your choices meet the requirements of specific applications;\nDescribe the importance of carrier-envelope phase stability of sources of single- and sub-cycle light pulses and optical frequency combs;\nDesign a methodology for the generation of low-frequency mid-IR or THz radiation based on principles of nonlinear optical down-conversion (either perturbative or non-perturbative) and explain the interaction dynamics using a theoretical framework;\nAnalyze laboratory generated spectroscopic data to extract physical properties of matter.",
    "Content": "The course comprises of three blocks: fundamentals, practical systems, and applications. The\nblocks cover the following topics:\n• Primers: review of laser essentials and overview of ultra-short light pulses;\n• Generation and modelling of ultrafast laser pulses;\n• Dispersion of ultra-short pulses and pulse compression techniques\n• Measurement techniques for ultrafast pulses: correlation methods and full electric field\nreconstruction;\n• Evolution of chirped pulse amplification\n• Parametric amplification and frequency conversion\n• Carrier envelope phase stability, few-cycle pulses and optical frequency combs;\n• Modern ultrafast laser systems\n• Ultrafast mid-infrared and THz sources;\n• Hot topics in ultrafast science, including ultrafast THz spectroscopy",
