    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to provide participants with fundamental understanding and skills required to design and implement integrated robotics and automation solutions in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment. The students will learn about automation, robotics, perception and safety and will need to synthesize these topics within an integrated working system. By developing a solution to a real-life problem, participants will be able to identify the necessary components, communication strategies and safety measures specific to the pharmaceutical manufacturing domain. The course offers participants an opportunity to work on a use-case in pharma manufacturing to directly apply the lessons learned.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify various devices and components used in industrial automation\nUse PLC and robot programming languages to develop code for pharmaceutical manufacturing applications\nArgue about the choice of an appropriate controller, way of communication and safety components\nDesign and program a safety system based on basic risk assessment\nExplain and reason various regulatory requirements in pharma manufacturing\nDesign and implement interfaces and interlocks between different systems within pharmaceutical manufacturing such as e,g, robot, PLC, vision system.\nAnalyze a problem of integrating an industrial automation system and formulate specifications and success criteria\nExplain and communicate the concept and solution to an industrial automation system integration problem\nWork in a team to solve a complex task",
    "Content": "The course introduces various devices, components and communication protocols used in industrial automation and how to choose the appropriate one for the specific application. The course focuses on how the automated systems interact in a real production environment. It gives an insight into various aspects and regulations that need to be considered when designing an automation system, and the additional requirements specific to pharma manufacturing. The content of the course is built around a concrete, real-life task where the learnings can be directly applied and aimed to give practical skills in programming PLCs, HMIs, industrial robots and vision systems.\nThe structure of the course will combine selected lectures at DTU on topics such as industrial robot arms, PLC programming, and robot vision, each followed by hands-on development in the premises of NNE (Novo Nordisk Engineering) in Virum.",
