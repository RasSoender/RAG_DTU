    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nDigital solutions such as digital twins are expected to play a major role in the realization of the future energy sector i.e. smart grids and smart cities as well as the industrial sector i.e. industry 4.0. The backbone of such digitalization relies on the development of numerical models that are conceptually, physically and mathematically consistent and tailored to the specific objective of the application.\n\nThe aim of the course is to give the students experience in developing numerical models of complex thermal energy technologies such as: heat pumps, organic Rankine cycles, refrigeration systems, gas turbines and industrial process facilities. Further, the students will learn to apply these models to simulate and analyze the technologies in question. Further, the students will learn to couple numeric models with measurement data to provide digital services, such as advanced monitoring using virtual sensors, fault detection or predictive maintenance.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDevelop models of complex thermal energy technologies by utilizing a systematic model development procedure\nAssess the conceptual and numerical validity of the developed models\nDesign and assess thermal energy technologies by using simulations of the developed models\nFormulate a simulation objective and sketch how models and data can be used to fulfill the objective\nImplement different model complexities i.e. design, operational and transient models\nSelect the appropriate model complexity\nImplement different approaches to model component characteristics i.e. empirical or first principle and lumped or distributed models\nSelect the appropriate approach to model component characteristics\nDescribe the functionality of a controller and implement PI controllers in transient models.\nUtilize appropriate simulation software to simulate thermal energy technologies\nApply numerical methods, for solving systems of algebraic, differential and differential-algebraic equations\nProvide constructive peer-feedback on reports and project presentations of fellow students",
    "Content": "The course focuses on the application of modelling and simulation systematics to ensure the development of models that are conceptually, physically and mathematically consistent. The students will learn how to apply a structured modelling and simulation process to develop models for various applications (including digital services) and will further learn to select the appropriate model complexity.\n\nThe students will be introduced to the principles of different numerical solvers such as Newton-Raphson and Runge-Kutta and the practical applications of these. Further, the students will gain practical experience in the use of simulation software suitable for simulating thermal energy technologies. An introduction will be given to Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Modelica as well as fluid properties software such as CoolProp or Refprop.\n\nThe students will work on two group projects throughout the course. The first project focusses on developing a design model for a thermal energy technology and will assess the influence of different cycle and component design variables. The second project focusses on defining a digital service and developing a suitable model that can be coupled to measurement data to fulfill the defined simulation objective. Both projects should be documented and analysed in a technical report.",
