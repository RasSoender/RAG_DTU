    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective is to give the students an understanding of what a plasma is, how it behaves, which scientific and industrial contexts plasmas appear in. The course will give the student insight into how the dynamics in plasma is modeled mathematically and numerically, and on the basis of simplified models give the student the ability to model fundamental plasma phenomena. Acquired knowledge from this course provides a foundation for advanced studies of fusion plasmas, astrophysical plasmas and process plasmas that are applied in a broad range of industrial processes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the general characteristics of a plasma, its application and occurrence\nCompute charged particle trajectories in electric and magnetic fields\nDescribe basic elements of tokamaks and stellarators\nCompute the effects of collisions in plasmas\nDeduce the continuum equations of motion for plasmas\nDeduce the magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion for plasmas\nDeduce the kinetic equations of motion for plasmas\nDescribe fundamental wave phenomena in plasmas\nAccount for the exchange of energy between waves and particles\nAssess which models should be used in describing a given plasma phenomenon\nDescribe plasma equilibrium states and associated electric and magnetic fields\nCalculate the stability of plasmas",
    "Content": "Fundamental equations of motion for populations of charged particles in electromagnetic fields including self-generated fields. Magnetohydrodynamic, continuum and kinetic descriptions. Plasma equilibrium states and criteria for stability. Collisions. Wave phenomena in plasma. Resonance and total reflection. Elementary dielectric effects in thermal plasmas. Plasma in space and laboratory, fusion plasma.",
