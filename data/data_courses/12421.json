    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the participants - on the basis of an advanced knowledge of strength and deformation characteristics of soils - to predict stress paths followed by soil based on its initial state. The participants will develop the ability to select the appropriate soil parameters from laboratory tests and use them as input in constitutive models.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe oedometer, direct shear or triaxial test and be able to perform one of them on clay and/or sand\nInterpret soil behaviour from oedometer, direct shear or triaxial tests or a combination of them to establish design parameters, such as strength and stiffness, and critical state parameters\nStructure, present and discuss laboratory test results in an interpretation report\nManipulate 3D stress and strain, for example using operator split between volumetric and deviatoric components, as an input in constitutive equations\nDescribe qualitatively the expected stress-strain soil behaviour using the Critical State framework\nDescribe qualitatively the changes in soil strength and stiffness, based on soil state both in terms of stress and density using the Critical State framework and including the effects of stress history\nUse Critical State framework to predict soil behaviour in terms of soil stress and strain\nCompare predicted and observed behaviour and link the difference to geological processes through sensitivity framework",
    "Content": "Laboratory testing. Advanced soil behaviour. Constitutive equations, yield criteria, plasticity theory, strain softening and hardening.",
    "Remarks": "This course is a prerequisite for Advanced geotechnical engineering (12422) and Numerical modelling in soil mechanics (12423)",
