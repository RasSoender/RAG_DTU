    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nEfficient handling of energy becomes increasingly important whether we choose to base the future energy system on renewable energy, or we continue to consume the fossil reserves. The 1st law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved and can neither be created, nor consumed, so why do we have problems with energy? It is typically the usable part of the energy that is decisive and of interest in energy analyses, so why not put it into system by the term exergy. The student will understand the concept of exergy and will be able to apply it to different subprocesses which can be combined into more complex systems. The course will also provide a better understanding of reversibility, entropy and sustainability in our energy systems as well as in a broader sense.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the concept of entropy as a practical abstraction\nAccount for the difference between reversible and irreversible processes\nExplain the term exergy as a measure of the quality of the energy and its ability to perform work\nAccount for the difference between energy efficiency and exergy efficiency\nCalculate exergy consumption in common physical processes\nCalculate exergy consumption in chemical processes\nCarry out an exergy analysis on a system with some complexity\nIdentify the most irreversible steps in a process\nAssess exergy consumption in energy conversion processes",
    "Content": "The 1st and the 2nd laws of thermodynamics. A more thorough introduction to the concept of entropy than is normally seen at introductory courses on thermodynamics. Assessment of popular descriptions of entropy as disorder, scattering, information and the arrow of time. Exergy as a measure of energy quality. Exergy consumption in physical processes. Exergy consumption in chemical processes. Exergy analysis of selected systems such as cooling machines, engines, fuel cells, chemical industry and electricity production.",
