    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThrough participation in a small research project, the student will try to answer a question, which is connected to the work of the supervising PhD student. The student will gain forefront knowledge of an area within Life Science, while gaining insight into how the scientific method is put into practice to solve pressing issues facing society. The student will also gain general competencies, e.g. the ability to participate in a constructive mentor-mentee relationships and the ability to communicate science – in writing as well as orally.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nwork in a focused and strategic manner to retrieve scientific literature.\nread scientific articles and extract information of relevance to a scientific project.\ncritically evaluate own and others experimental designs.\nplan, carry out and finalise a project under tight time constraints.\norally communicate the main features of a scientific issue.\ncommunicate the results of a scientific project in a report shaped like a scientific article.\nconstructively participate in a student-supervisor relationship.\nuse state-of-the-art methods from the given scientific field to analyse data.",
    "Content": "Participation in a short-term research project in close collaboration with a supervising PhD student. The exact content of the project will be further agreed upon with the supervising PhD student. The main points of the scientific issue must be communicated orally to the other participants of the course. The project must be communicated via a final, written report.",
