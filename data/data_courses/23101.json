    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the students to analyse and understand food production chains and the interdependence of the parts of these. The focus is on understanding the interactions between production, quality, raw material properties and rheology as well as mass and energy balance, process design, product management and innovation aspects on a basic level. The focus of this course is,on an introductory level, to understand and combine the different elements in the whole production chain.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse a food production chain (from raw material to consumer) and identify safety, quality and planning issues, and the interactions between these and process operations.\nDefine the degree of innovation in relation to the theoretically developed product.\nApply strategic tools for product management\nApply mass and energy balance related to the unit operations.\nIdentify raw material properties of importance to the final product.\nDescribe the major parameters that influence the quality of food.\nEvaluate where in the value chain optimisation in relation to quality can be addressed.\nValidate solutions to practical problems using quantitative and qualitative methods.\nMake concise executive summary and oral presentation of a technical matter.\nGive constructive feedback to contribution from other course participants.\nWrite (as team-work) a technical report suitable for decision making in a company.",
    "Content": "The course aims to teach the student how to understand and analyse the basic interactions along food production chains. The interactions concern quality, processes and product management all of which must be considered as integral in order to make proper production planning and design. Theoretical production of food products from raw material to consumer will be analysed and solutions suggested by teams. Team work is central in the course, and the teams are introduced to diversity and communication within team work. The teams will study cases that exemplify a wide range of common issues in various steps associated to food production. Furthermore, separate elements are included such as process technology, mass and energy balances, bottlenecks and challenges for the food industry as well as innovation and sustainability. Generic competences such as reporting, presentation techniques and constructive feedback among students is also elements of this master introduction course. Guest lectures are invited as part of the course. If possible, excursions will be arranged to relevant actors in the food sector.\nThe course format is a combination of learning through lectures (acqusition), search and evaluate literature (inquiry), discussions among students and teacher, collaboration and production through team work aiming for a shared output (report), developing and prensenting results, concepts and practise.",
    "Remarks": "The course is compulsory for the MSc in Food Technology",
