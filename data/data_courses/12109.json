    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide targeted technological knowledge of the basic processes and methods that are important in the physical-chemical treatment (e.g. membrane separation, electrochemistry and absorption) of water including industrial water, drinking water, and wastewater. Based on a solid theoretical understanding of the principles of the methods, students should be able to assess the technological applicability of the methods in water treatment, using simple hand calculations and exercises. Furthermore, to see one or more of the methods in use through excursions to relevant full scale facilities / installations in the metropolitan area. Emphasis is placed on the technologies seen in a broad context for the treatment of many types of water - relevant both nationally and internationally.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe different physicochemical water treatment methods for different types of water including drinking water, water for industrial use, as well as wastewater\nExplain the principles of the methods based on qualitative and quantitative understanding of the physicochemical principles of the processes\nComplete reaction kinetic calculations for the central processes\nConduct calculations of concentrations and mass balances in the central processes\nAssess the methods in relation to their technological applicability in water treatment including hygienic, economic and practical aspects relevant to the methods used\nDescribe how the different processes apply in current treatment technologies\nAssess the potential for future use of the central processes in 'new' types of water treatment technologies\nDocument and explain results obtained in the course's exercises in the form of minor technical reports\nRead, understand and evaluate relevant literature and primary literature (eg scientific articles) on key processes\nBased on excursions, discussing and assessing why in these cases, they have chosen precisely these technologies in relation to alternative technologies\nProvide examples of challenges in the development and implementation of new water treatment technologies",
    "Content": "The course combines theoretical knowledge in lectures with less computational exercises and practical knowledge obtained through laboratory exercises. A significant industrial element is included in the course in the form of technical company presentations and visits to relevant 'users' of selected physicochemical water treatment technologies.\nSpecifically, the course will cover the following subjects:\n• Membrane-based separation technology\n• Chlorination, oxidation and disinfection technologies\n• Electrochemical technologies\n• Precipitation & Coagulation Technology\n• Sorption (activated carbon, ion exchange) technology\n• Particle Removal & Settlement Technology\n• Aeration & Gas Exchanging Technology",
