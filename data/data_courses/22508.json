    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a highly versatile method that allows unique insight into complex systems, such as living cells. The participants obtain insight into theoretical and practical aspects of modern NMR methodology and learn how to design NMR assays for biotechnology, technical chemistry and medicine. Besides High-field NMR assays the course emphasises the complementary NMR approach, Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP). The DNP technique provides a physical labelling approach to enhance signals of probe molecules by >3 orders of magnitudes for fast NMR assays of for instance living systems from cell to man. Using laboratory exercises, the participants will acquire hands-on experience with all steps from sample preparation to data acquisition, analysis and interpretation in assay development using current examples from chemical, biochemical and medical research.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the basic principles behind NMR and DNP.\nunderstand key acquisition parameters and use these for own data collection.\nconduct and analyze 2D NMR experiments on complex mixtures.\nConduct DNP sample preparation and acquire data of the DNP process in the solid state as an example of producing a molecular probe.\nconduct and analyze kinetic reaction experiments with NMR and DNP.\ncompare the suitability of NMR and DNP in selected projects.\nsuggest state of the art NMR experiments for a molecular understanding of real world problems (ex. pathways in chemical reaction and metabolism).\nformulate and investigate a scientific problem using modern (DNP)NMR spectroscopy studies, including dissemination in written and oral form.",
    "Content": "Basic NMR for interpretation of spectra; quantitative NMR of mixtures; kinetics of catalyzed reactions; use of NMR and metabolite data bases; group work on scientific problems within the field of medicine (e.g, cancer cells, cellular dysfunction, pathogen metabolism) and chemical reaction (e.g. intermediates and complex mixtures from reaction) resulting in report. At the exam, the student will present the problem based on the written report.",
    "Remarks": "Exercises take place in specialised laboratories using unique equipment under supervision.",
