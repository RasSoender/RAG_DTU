    "course title": "22102 Applied Single Cell Bioinformatics",
    "Danish title": "Anvendt Single Cell Bioinformatik",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Bioinformatics\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Quantitative Biology and Disease Modelling\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Bioinformatics and Systems Biology",
    "Schedule": "January",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The course is run as a \"flipped classroom\", i.e., you prepare from home by reading material, watching lectures, etc., to ensure a larger proportion of the in-class time can be used on applied computational exercises.",
    "Duration of Course": "3 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "The last day, The multiple choice exam will be midway in the course just before the project starts (see description)",
    "Type of assessment": "Written and oral examination\nThe exam consists of 3 parts: 1) A 1 hour written multiple choice exam based on the general course learning objectives. 2) A single-cell analysis project made in groups where all members are responsible for all parts of the project. 3) An oral group presentation of the project. The final grade is based on an overall assessment of all three parts of the exam.",
    "Exam duration": "Written exam: 1 hour",
    "Aid": "No Aid :\nNo aids allowed for the multiple choice exam. All aids are allowed during the group project",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , internal examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "22101.22100.22126 , Knowledge of cells, cell types, cell structure, their biological function, subcomponents, biochemical and molecular processes (metabolism, RNA- and protein synthesis). Knowledge of next generation sequencing (NGS), mapping, and mapping QC. For the entire course, we will use R to organize, analyze, and visualize data. This also means we expect that you are already comfortable with programming in R. You do not have time to learn that during this course. If you do not know how to solve basic data manipulation tasks in R (examples listed below), you will need to learn this BEFORE taking this course in order to be able to keep up. Examples of data analysis you need to know how to do in R prior to course start (without looking it up online): • Merge two datasets based on a shared identifier • Do a per-group operation of data based on a grouping column • Do a per-row or per-column operation without using loops • Use ggplot2 to visualize data, e.g., a scatterplot where points are colored by category",

    "Department": "22 Department of Health Technology",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAfter you have taken this course, you will be able to do state-of-the-art bioinformatics analysis of single-cell data. The main focus in the course is on single-cell RNA-sequencing but we will also cover both spatial and multimodal single-cell data.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nindependently seek out and obtain relevant information about single-cell data analysis.\nlist various single-cell technologies along with relevant biological use-cases.\ndiscuss strengths and weaknesses for various single-cell technologies.\nassess strengths and weaknesses with various experimental setups.\nlist various bioinformatic analysis tools and what they are used for.\ndiscuss strengths, weaknesses, and key parameters for various analysis approaches.\napply and interpret state-of-the-art bioinformatic analysis to single-cell data in the biological context of the data.\nuse R to organize, modify, and visualize data.\nas part a group design and execute a single-cell analysis project.\nclearly present obtained results orally using proper visual aids.",
    "Content": "The first part of the course will introduce and have you work with various single-cell technologies and analyses, including, but not limited to:\n• Single-cell RNA-seq\n• Dimensionality reduction, integration, clustering, and cell-type annotation\n• Downstream analysis such as differential expression and differential cell type abundance\n• Multimodal single-cell analysis\n• Spatial transcriptomics\n\nIn the second half of the course, you will have to do a group-based project on real data. For this project, you can work on data we provide or bring your own data (e.g., from your master thesis or PhD project) as long as the dataset has been approved by a teacher.",
