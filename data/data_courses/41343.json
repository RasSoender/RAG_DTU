    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose with the course is to learn the basic combustion related processes that are responsible for the emissions from transport. Emissions from combustion are put into perspective in order to assess the total emissions from current and future transport, taking into account the most realistic future scenarios for future use of fuels and technology. It is an important goal that the students are getting familiar with practical measurements and chemical analysis in relation to combustion of conventional and sustainable fuels.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEvaluate and perspectivate the application of relevant transport fuels and technologies for future transportation\nEvaluate the relevance of the different tranport associated combustion process emissions in relation to the applied fuel\nExplain the combustion chemistry\nCalculate flame temperatures\nExplain the mechanisms behind emission formation in combustion engines\nCarry out simple quantitative calculations of emissions from the application of different fuels in combustion engines\nExplain the working principle in the included measurement principles\nCarry out measurements of particulate compositions\nEvaluate the quality of the fuel consumption and emission measurements carried out",
    "Content": "An introduction to possibilities and barriers for implementation of alternative fuels in transportation will be given. In the course the students are presented to theoretical topics related to combustion and air pollution formation in connection with application of different fuels (conventional, biofuels and electro fuels) and technologies (combustion engines electric motors and fuel cells). These topics are: stoichiometry, combustion reactions, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, determination of calorific value and flame temperature. As a general example the student will be introduced to a vehicle with a combustion engine. The students should solve written problems from this example. An essential part of the course is the practical laboratory work where gaseous emission measurements are demonstrated and carried out. Samples of particulate matter from the vehicle are analyzed in order to determine their composition as well. In this context different separation and detection principles are presented. The following topics are included: gas/liquid and high performance liquid chromatography, open column chromatography and infra red/UV/fluorescence/flame ionization/chemiluminescence detectors.",
