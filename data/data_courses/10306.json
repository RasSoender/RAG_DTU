    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo equip you with the necessary theoretical and numerical tools to understand the diverse emergent phenomena originating from strong light-matter interaction. The course will provide you with basics on optical properties of two-dimensional materials and you will be introduced to research-level methodologies to treat their strong interaction with classical and quantum light.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nList the relevant symmetries in 2D materials\nConstruct tight-binding models for most representative 2D materials\nModel the optical response of 2D Materials\nDerive Electric and Magnetic Fields in quantized form\nList and explain the different gauge choices\nDerive Light-matter coupling from local charge conservation\nExplain the consequence of periodic laser driving of materials\nApply Floquet theory to engineer band structures in 2D materials\nModel the formation of composite polaritons",
    "Content": "Tight-binding models of representative 2D materials, Electronic structure and valley degrees of freedom, Optical linear response theory, Excitons. Light-Matter interaction Hamiltonians, gauge freedom, Floquet theory, the concept of Polaritons, low-energy Quantum electrodynamics (QED), basics of Cavity material engineering.",
