    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce to the student simulations of indoor environment and energy use of systems and buildings in IDA ICE. To enable the student to design and assign systems to a building geometry, and specify customized controls of HVAC systems. To evaluate the modelling approach and simulation output and understand the working principles of building energy simulation programs and in particular of IDA ICE. To understand the structure of stochastic models of occupant behaviour and to assess their applicability in simulations. The course enables the participants to use advanced tools for building performance simulation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine building envelope properties and system characteristics in IDA ICE\nOutline the basic working principles of IDA ICE and related simulation programs\nRelate simulation variables to model functionality\nInterpret results of the version handling system and parametric simulations\nDistinguish between variables, parameters and interfaces in the structure of objects in IDA ICE\nDesign customized and advanced control macros for the operation of HVAC systems\nIntegrate stochastic models of occupantsâ€™ behaviour in a control macro\nAssess model validity based on simulation outputs",
    "Content": "General hands on experience using standard and advanced levels of IDA ICE. Load calculations in IDA ICE. Approach for simulation of indoor environment and building energy. Mathematical modelling approach used by IDA ICE (zone divisions, controllers etc.). Version handling system and the \"Parametric Runs\" tool in IDA ICE (tools for quick and easy parameter variations and optimisations). Macros and advanced controls. Output files and logging of variables. Analysis of results.",
    "Remarks": "The course targets engineering students at master level that are interested in the use of advanced, state-of-the-art methodologies and programs to simulate the consequences for indoor environment and building energy consumption of decisions made at the design stage. However, the course may also be followed by PhD students with the required basic knowledge that are interested in learning how to use the advanced levels of IDA ICE.\n\nThe course relies on students bringing their own PC. The programs used in the course requires a Windows based PC. Students using MAC computers can use Boot Camp to install a Windows partition on their computer.",
