    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nSupply Chain Analytics (SCA) utilizes analytical techniques from statistics, machine learning, mathematical optimization and game theory in order to leverage the availability of large amounts of data towards improved decision making and planning across supply chains. The purpose of this course is to teach students the basics of building analytical models to solve supply chain problems, and to build intuition into the logic behind these tools and their potential impact on the competitiveness of supply chains.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain fundamental terminology and concepts in supply chain management and Supply Chain Analytics (SCA)\nDescribe the data sources that provide the input needed for different SCA tools and interpret the output provided by SCA tools\nAnalyze supply chain planning and design problems within an SCA framework\nAssess the applicability of SCA in different situations\nApply and compare SCA tools to solve supply chain planning and design problems\nDevelop unified solution approaches to given supply chain problems by appropriately combining different SCA tools\nDiscuss the impact SCA can have on the performance of supply chains\nDescribe how SCA can be used to gather important managerial insights about improving supply chain performance",
    "Content": "This course will introduce students to complex networks consisting of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, etc., that collaborate in bringing a product or service to the customer. It will be shown how activities within supply networks can be coordinated and integrated using SCA in order to reduce systemwide costs and improve customer service. An end-to-end view of supply chain management is therefore taken. On the customer-facing side, students will use SCA for demand forecasting and order fulfillment. On the internal side, SCA will be used for network design, inventory management and production planning. Finally, on the supply side, SCA will be used for supplier selection, supply contract design, outsourcing and vertical/horizontal collaboration. The SCA tools used will be drawn from a wide range of analytical domains, including probability theory, statistics, machine learning, mathematical programming and game theory.",
