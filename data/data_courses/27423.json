    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students an overview of the main types of small organic molecules, proteins, and post-translational modifications that living organisms such as microorganisms, plants, and mammalian cells can biosynthesize, and how they can be extracted and prepared for chemical and quantitative analysis. The major objective of the course is to give the students a solid understanding of chromatographic based analytical methods with special emphasis on analysis and detection of both known and unknown compounds by interpretation of mass spectrometric data. Up-to-date mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques will also be presented and discussed. The course aims broadly at students studying biotechnology, organic chemistry and pharma technology, who want to strengthen their analytical chemical knowledge and learn about modern mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods, applications and data processing.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the general principles of sample preparation of small organic molecules and proteins, e.g. using solid phase extraction (SPE).\nExplain the general principle of chromatography (LC, GC) including the use of different relevant types of columns.\nExplain the general principles of diode array detection (DAD) and mass spectrometry (e.g. QTOF) coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-DAD-MS).\nDemonstrate the principles of dereplication and mass spectrometry.\nPerform data analysis using standard instrumental software for LC-DAD-MS analysis.\nCompare analytical results to information in commercial databases.\nExplain the basic principles behind quantitative analysis of small organic molecules.\nExplain the principles behind liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry based (e.g. Orbitrap and MALDI TOF) analysis of proteins and modified proteins.\nDescribe common methodology in proteomics, interactomics, and post-tranlational modification omics-based workflows from different sample types.\nUnderstand and apply various ways of conducting quantitative proteomics analyses, e.g label-free vs. labeled, and Data-Dependent Acquisition vs. Data-Independent Acquisition.",
    "Content": "Industrial production of small organic biomolecules (metabolites or natural products), proteins and modified proteins using microbial cell factories and mammalian cells, and cell products destined for cell therapies, is estimated to increase dramatically in the coming years. This includes important products such as antibiotics, anticancer agents, smaller proteins, and food ingredients like aroma compounds, pigments, antioxidants and vitamins. Other metabolites are toxic to humans and are therefore to be avoided in food and feed. Moreover, the need for improved understanding of cell behaviour at the molecular, and especially, protein level, has increased demands for improved proteomics workflows on ever decreasing sample amounts in a wide array of biological systems. This course will teach the basic principles behind modern methods for analysis of small organic molecules and proteins, especially based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The topics will be presented in a mixture of lectures, exercises, group work with presentations.",
