    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course will provide you with the knowledge and tools for measuring, understanding and managing water pollution and the state of aquatic ecosystems, through:\n1. Understanding the relation between physical and chemical pollution of surface waters and life in aquatic ecosystems\n2. Assessing water pollution from various contaminant sources by applying chemical, biological and mathematical methods\n3. Modelling techniques to analyze & predict the development of aquatic systems\n4. Ecology of lakes and rivers\n4. Knowledge of restoration techniques\n5. Brief, the course deals with pollution of surface waters such as rivers, lakes and coastal marine waters.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the basic structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems (lakes and rivers).\nDescribe national and international water quality objectives.\nIdentify threats to water quality (which pollutants, which regulations).\nCharacterize sources, behavior and effects of organic, inorganic and biological water pollutants (e.g. BOD; nutrients; xenobiotics, invasive species)\nGet to know biological and chemical methods to measure and describe water quality (Saprobia index, chemical analysis).\nLearn about actual research about various chemical stressors for aquatic life.\nDevelop and implement models for assessing water quality (oxygen models; transport models).\nInvestigate rivers and lakes.\nGet to know restoration options for eutrophic lakes.",
    "Content": "• Surface water pollution and quality problems\n• Sources and mitigation of pollution impacting streams, lakes and coastal areas\n• General water quality parameters (nutrients; organic matter, oxygen)\n• Life in and under water\n• Sediment as a source and sink of contaminants and nutrients\n• Analysis of surface water systems using various modelling approaches.\n• Environmental legislative framework\n• Rivers, lakes and coastal waters",
