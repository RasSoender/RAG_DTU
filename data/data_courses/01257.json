    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce the students to advanced mathematical modelling through the solution of a project problem from engineering, medicine or physics. Most projects will be about models of differential equations. The course is therefore a natural next step for students of 01617, providing a unique opportunity for putting some theoretical knowledge into practice.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDiscuss essential principles of mathematical modelling\nExplain a mathematical model listing its assumptions\nAnalyse a mathematical model using mathematical analysis\nSet up and do relevant numerical experiments\nGive correct mathematical arguments for the particular model\nOrganize project work in small groups\nMake conclusions concerning the technical problem based on the obtained results\nWrite a well-structured report that concisely explains the model, the mathematical analysis, the numerical calculations, and the conclusions made.",
    "Content": "We consider a mathematical model of a scientific problem originating in for instance engineering, and we analyze the model using mathematical theory. In addition, the model is implemented numerically and through numerical simulations the phenomena are investigated. Students that have taken course 01617 will be offered tailored projects where students will be able to apply dynamical systems theory to real-world problems. Students are expected to work in groups (2-4 persons) with the concrete project.",
