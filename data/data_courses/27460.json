    "Danish title": "Syntesebiologi",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nGeneral competence course (MSc), Biotechnology\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Biotechnology",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E5A (Wed 8-12)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The lecture series introduces the basic concepts of Synthetic Biology and molecular biological tools for genetic engineering of production organisms. In the weekly theoretical exercises, we develop competences in the design, building, testing, and learning in SynBio experiments and how to evaluate designs. In parallel, the students work in smaller teams to solve an exam project, giving the opportunity to apply the course topics in relation to the exam project.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "Decide with teacher, Last teaching session in the 13 week period",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\n1. Individualized group report (80%) covering project work, must be handed in one week prior to the oral exam. 2. Oral exam (20%) covering project work, held the last session of the 13-weeks period.",

    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course introduces the basic terminology and concepts of synthetic biology and the mindset on which it depends. The course, further, equips the students with the necessary analytical tools to evaluate and design the complex molecular biological experiments needed for implementing bioengineering solutions to industry-relevant problems",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the difference between parts, devices and circuits in synthetic biology\nExplain and apply standardized approaches for DNA assembly (molecular cloning)\nDesign biological parts, devices and basic circuits\nCreate and analyze mathematical models of simple regulatory circuits and genetic switches\nEvaluate the feasibility of existing experimental designs for the implementation of SynBio solutions\nDesign detailed molecular biological experiments, incl. predict the possible outcomes of the individual steps and the required experimental control reactions\nEvaluate the pros and cons of different parts and chassis (organisms) in connection with a given synthetic biological design\nDescribe how instrumentation and automation of the laboratory (use of robotics) can enable synthetic biology\nDesigning experiments that lead to heterogeneous clones/DNA libraries\nDesign feasible screening strategies for identifying clones with a desirable functionality within a library\nDesign cell factories for the production of small molecules and proteins/enzymes\nDiscuss the ethical implications of synthetic biology, and Perform risks assessment of projects.",
    "Content": "The course introduces Synthetic Biology and the underlying concepts and notions.\n\nThe course focuses on the design of molecular biological experiments and screening strategies (= the participant will have to actively design/device experiments on a weekly basis). After the course, the participants will be able to design all steps necessary to implement complex genetic engineering experiments, e.g. cloning strategies, necessary experimental controls, expected outcomes of the different steps, and efficient screening assays for identifying cells with the desired functionalities.\n\nThe central concepts and mindset within Synthetic Biology is introduced through textbook chapters, original literature, lectures, and case discussions. Detailed design of complex molecular biological experiments is trained via weekly theoretical assignments and plenum discussions of the different team’s solutions. The ethical and commercial aspects of Synthetic Biology are treated during the case discussions and design exercises.",
    "Course literature": "Original literature in the form of peer-review articles, selected textbook chapters and cloning procedure manuals.",
