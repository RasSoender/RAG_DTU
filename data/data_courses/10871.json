    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nHow do we design a solar cell that can potentially convert light into electricity at maximum efficiency? And how do we then optimize the solar cell towards actually achieving this goal? In this course, you will learn how to find answers to these questions by guided hands-on work centered on solar cell simulation, and complemented by measurements on real solar cells and materials data mining.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the material properties (e.g., band gaps, doping densities) and device properties (e.g. layer thicknesses, contact configuration) that are relevant in the design and simulation of a solar cell\nFind appropriate reference values for such properties in the scientific literature or databases\nRun realistic solar cell simulations in one dimension with the SCAPS program\nSimulate the effect of changing a given property on solar cell performance (efficiency, short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor)\nExplain reasons for the observed property-performance trends, using mathematical relations based on semiconductor physics and/or auxiliary simulations\nDerive fundamental limits to the power conversion efficiency of solar cells (e.g., Shockley-Queisser limit) from simulation work\nDiagnose solar cell performance issues by conducting current-voltage, quantum efficiency, and capacitance measurements on a real solar cell\nEstimate unknown properties by fitting the measurement results to a device simulation model\nApply data mining techniques to select potential solar cell materials from online materials databases\nDesign an optimal solar cell (materials and device structure) given a set of specifications",
    "Content": "This is a learn-by-doing course, where most of the relevant math and physics will not be presented beforehand, but it will instead be derived from your hands-on work. The general teaching format consists of a three-step loop: 1) Briefing in plenum with introductory concepts and instructions for the hands-on work; 2) Hands-on work in groups (either simulation, data mining, or experiment); 3) Debriefing in plenum with conclusions from the hands-on work.\n\nIn the first week, you will learn about the relevant properties of solar cell materials and the architecture of a solar cell. By computer simulation, you will derive the key elements of the physics of solar cells and the role of the various properties in determining the behavior of a solar cell.\n\nIn the second week, you will go to the lab and conduct the measurements that are typically used to characterize a real solar cell. You will learn to integrate these measurements with the simulation program to diagnose issues and estimate unknown properties in the solar cell. Then, you will learn to query large computational material databases to search for potentially improved solar cell materials with optimal properties.\n\nIn the third week, you will work on a group project, where each group will use their experience from the course to design a solar cell given a set of specifications. Each group will write a final report based on this project.",
