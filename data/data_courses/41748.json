    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall objective of the course is to give the students understanding and knowledge of numerical modelling of materials and manufacturing engineering with special focus on thermomechanical phenomena in welding, surface hardening and manufacturing of composites. The students will learn about modeling (numerical as well as analytical) methods for thermal stresses and strains during manufacturing in metals and composites. This is achieved by programming the numerical methods themselves as well as applying commercial software.\nThe applied methods are of general nature and can be applied in a wide range of industrial branches, for example automotive, maritime as well as wind energy.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the concepts of thermal strains and thermal stresses\nUnderstand how volumetric strains (thermal, chemical..) play together with classical elasto-plastic theory as well as classical laminate theory\nApply numerical as well as analytical methods to calculate thermal stresses in processes like welding, additive manufacturing, surface hardening and resin transfer moulding\nUse Matlab to solve partial differential equations\nUse Matlab to solve thermomechanical problems\nEvaluate the validity of numerical methods by comparison with relevant analytical solutions\nAssess the possibilities of solving thermal stress problems with analytical and numerical methods\nExplain the importance of thermally induced residual stresses for the subsequent mechanical performance of manufactured parts",
