    "Department": "30 National Space Institute",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo complete a project where an open problem is solved, in which a combination of skills and competencies obtained through the technological specialization and the normative competence courses are used. Teamwork is strongly encouraged.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe, design, construct, validate and choose solutions in the form of monitoring, mapping or exploration systems or parts hereof by combining measurement technologies with an understanding of physical processes and structures\ncomplete a larger development project\nanalyse a heteorogeneous problem and formulate a precise requirements specification for the task to be solved\nperform problem, design and implementation oriented analyses and discuss advantages and disadvantages for alternative solutions\nmake a plan for how a task can be solved on time with the available ressources\nexplore and analyze relevant technologies for solving the given problem\nsubstantiate the choice of technologies on the basis of clearly formulated premises\ncomplete a larger development project, including the production of technical documentation that makes clear how major concepts from the problem formulation are traceable in the implementation\ncarry the project through with great independence in all aspects\nwrite a well-structured and well-documented report that presents results and analyses in a precise and clear way.",
    "Content": "The exact project and theme will be agreed upon between the student(s) and a supervisor chosen by the student in connection with the enrollment.\nA synthesis project must be such that the student(s) develop/implement/design something themselves. It must not be a project mainly aiming to achieve new scientific knowledge through data analysis using existing software or models. The project may contain a minor element of this, though.",
    "Remarks": "The course is a framework course only for the students in the master program, Earth and Space Physics and Engineering, to enable them to fulfil the synthesis requirement. PhD students and postdocs can be involved in the supervision of the synthesis project but can not act as primary supervisors.",
