    "Danish title": "Polymerer i processer og produkter",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Applied Chemistry\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Chemical and Biochemical Engineering\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Applied Chemistry",
    "Schedule": "August",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "Project work in groups. As a start each group visits a company with a polymer-based production. Preparation of a poster or pitch and presentation of the project work in plenum concludes the course work.",
    "Duration of Course": "3 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "Decide with teacher, No exam in the normal examination period",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and exercises\nOral exam takes form of group presentation and examination of the project work and the poster in plenum.",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , internal examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "28212/28213/41736/41737",
    "Responsible": "Anne Ladegaard Skov , Ph. (+45) 4525 2825 , al@kt.dtu.dk",
    "Department": "28 Department of Chemical Engineering",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall goals of the course are to give the students an introduction to the polymer related area - starting with a company visit and succeeded by project work. Through practical investigations that are employed in industry and are of significance for preparation and development of polymeric products, the experimental methods are enlightened and rehearsed.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe an industrial way of presenting a polymer problem\nPlan tests to solve the defined problem\nDevelop relevant methods of examinations\nOrganize the work in a heterogeneous group\nCarry out the planned investigations\nJudge partial results and modify the continued work\nInterpret and describe the performed investigations and experiments\nAdd up and report the results of the group in a poster format\nPresent partial results of the groupâ€™s entire work",
    "Content": "First day of the course is an elementary introduction to polymer properties. The second day each group will visit an industrial company and here recieve a problem, which is related to real life. The groups will plan and delegate their own experimental work necessary to solve the problem. Prerequisites for the individual problems may vary to suit the profiles of individual students. It is expected that approximately half of the course time is spent using laboratory equipment at the Danish Polymer Centre, which includes polymers synthesis, determination of molar mass, melting temperatures, glass transitions and identification of polymer types, as well as mechanical testing. On the last but one day a poster in Powerpoint format is handed in. On the last day the groups give oral presentations. This ensures that course participants will obtain a broad image of the polymer field.",
