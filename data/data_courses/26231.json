    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give an introduction to the theory of mass- and charge transport, kinetic theory of gases, and reaction dynamics. Furthermore, to give an introduction to the theory of energy states associated with the translational-, rotational- and vibrational motions of molecules, including nuclear- and electron spin, as a foundation for different spectroscopic techniques and statistical thermodynamics.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine transport coefficients to be used in the description of non-equilibrium phenomena in thermodynamic systems and apply them in calculations.\nExplain the kinetic model of ideal gasses.\nApply the kinetic model to calculate transport coefficients for ideal gasses.\nApply chemical kinetics to perform calculations of the rate of simple and complex chemical reactions.\nExplain the quantum mechanical background for the existence of spectra with well defined spectral lines.\nDescribe the interaction between electromagnetic fields and molecules.\nDetermine the structure and properties of molecules from spectroscopy.\nExplain the background for MW, IR, UV, and NMR spectroscopy.",
    "Content": "Mass and charge transport, diffusion and electrolytic conductivity. The kinetic model of gases. Topics in reaction kinetics, including adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis. Introduction to the atomic-level description of chemical reactions. Interaction between electromagnetic radiation and molecules, quantization of molecular energy, the Schrödinger equation, spectroscopy with microwave (MW), infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic (NMR)- and electron spin (ESR) resonans spectroscopy.",
