    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the participants a detailed understanding of the use of modelling and simulation for performance evaluation of communication systems and protocols. To give the participants skills in designing, implementing and using simulation models for performance evaluation of communication systems and protocols with the use of an advanced software tool. To provide participants with skills in analyzing, interpreting and presenting results from simulations.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAssess the usability of simulation for performance evaluation of communication systems\nDescribe the principles of event-driven simulation\nDesign simulation models of communication systems and/or protocols, based on, e.g., protocol specifications\nImplement simulation models in a simulation tool\nVerify and validate simulation models\nDocument the design, implementation, verification and validation of simulation models\nDesign and perform simulations\nDocument and evaluate simulation results",
    "Content": "Methods for performance evaluation, Types of models, Network modelling, Optimization of simulation models, Modelling tools, Event driven simulations. Simulation strategies. Processing and presentation of simulation results.",
    "Remarks": "Development of simulation models in the simulation tool that is used in the course requires that the participants has extensive knowledge and experience of software development in C++, using concepts such as objects, pointers, advanced data structures and algorithms, etc. Participants with little or no experience in C++ programming must expect that the course will require additional time and effort if a good result in the course is desired.",
