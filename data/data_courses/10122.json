    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo teach the student fundamental theoretical concepts within statistical physics and thereby provide a systematic foundation for using the introduced methods in new problem areas both of classical and of quantum nature. In addition, some of the techniques applied to handle interacting systems are introduced.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExpress thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for isolated, closed, as well as open systems.\nDetermine the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate in a wide spectrum of problems and establish the connection to thermodynamics through the entropy.\nArgue for the choice of appropriate statistical mechanical ensemble associated with a given problem and calculate physical properties by means of partition functions.\nSolve problems with non-interacting fermions, bosons, and quasiparticles (like photons).\nDescribe important properties of the Ising-model in 1 and 2 dimensions.\nEmploy mean-field models for describing phase transitions and properties of interacting systems.\nEstimate fluctuations in physical quantities, in particular in nanostructures.\nDiscuss characteristics of phase transitions and apply Landau free energy expansions on continuous phase transitions.\nSimulate simple statistical mechanical systems on a computer",
