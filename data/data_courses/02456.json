    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nMachine perception of natural signals has improved tremendously in recent years thanks to deep learning (DL). DL is the primary technology behind generative AI for images and text. Improved image recognition is leading to more accurate image-based medical diagnosis. Improved speech recognition and natural language processing with DL will lead to many new intelligent applications within health care and IT. Pattern recognition with DL in large datasets will give new tools for drug discovery, condition monitoring and many other data-driven applications.\n\nThis course gives the student a detailed understanding of the deep artificial neural network models, their training, computational frameworks for deployment on fast graphical processing units, their limitations and how to formulate learning in a diverse range of settings. These settings include classification, regression, sequences, and other types of structured input and outputs, as well as reasoning in complex environments.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDemonstrate knowledge of machine learning terminology such as likelihood function, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, feed-forward, convolutional, sequential and Transformer neural networks, and error back propagation.\nUnderstand and explain the choices and limitations of a model for a given setting.\nApply and analyze results from deep learning models in exercises and own project work*.\nPlan, delimit and carry out an applied or methods-oriented project in collaboration with fellow students and project supervisor*.\nAssess and summarize the project results in relation to aims, methods and available data*.\nCarry out the project and interpret results by use of computational framework for GPU programming such as PyTorch*.\nStructure and write a final short technical report including problem formulation, description of methods, experiments, evaluation and conclusion*.\nOrganize and present project results at the final project presentation and in report*.\nRead, evaluate and give feedback to work of other students.\n* If generative AI is used in these phases, then it needs to be documented and critically assessed. A checklist will be provided and should be handed in as part of the report.",

    "Remarks": "Deep learning-based machine learning is behind many recent advances in generative AI, speech recognition, image classification, and reinforcement learning. These developments have been mainly driven by the availability of fast computers, an abundance of data and algorithmic improvements for training neural networks. In the coming years, these methods can lead to technical advancements in many data-driven areas.\n\nDeep learning and machine learning generally see a lot of activity both within academia and industry. This course will provide the student with the foundation to apply deep learning in research and industry.\n\nThis is a machine learning course with a focus on computation and application. The project will be carried out with researchers at DTU or in a machine learning-based company.\n\nThe course is a part of the focus area Machine Learning and Signal Processing of the Master of Mathematical Modelling and Computing program.",
