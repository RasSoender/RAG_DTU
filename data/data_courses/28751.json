    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTypical chemical plants may contain hundreds of measurements and control loops. Most control theories (those you have seen in the introduction to process control) assume that a control structure is already given at the start, which reduces the problem to tuning and calculation of a control law. In practice, however, given a plant design with its process flow diagram, a control engineer faces the following problems: i) which variables should be controlled, ii) which variables should be measured, iii) which inputs should be manipulated, and iv) which links should be established between them? These are the questions that the plantwide control course addresses. To this end, a systematic methodology based on hierarchical decomposition of the control problem into layers is used for designing a plantwide control structure based on process understanding and with an economic production objective in mind. The performance of the control structure is then evaluated and further refined using dynamic simulations of the process in question in an iterative manner.\n\nThe goal of the course is thus to learn i) how data acquisition and controls are managed in an industrial setting; ii) to manage the complicated task of designing a control strategy for the entire plant or a multivariable process; iii) to understand process dynamics using dynamic simulations and process data; vi) to develop and implement a control strategy that meets control design objectives (stabilize the system, optimize the economics, environmental sustainability and satisfy the constraints); and v) evaluation of alternative solutions. Ultimately all these efforts are to help develop and operate better, safer, and optimal processes for chemical and biochemical industries.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse and tune PID control loop\nExplain how some relevant signals (temperature, pressure, flow rate) are acquired\nPerform a basic data visualization and analysis in Python\nDescribe industrial control systems infrastructure\nPerform a systematic analysis of the operation of chemical and biochemical process plants\nDerive a control structure based upon the process analysis\nCalculate the optimal point of operation and process schedules for the control system\nDerive simple linear models for control design from complex process systems\nAnalyse observability and controllability of a dynamical system\nDesign multivariable PID control structures\nDesign model based multivariable control structures\nEvaluate controller's performance using simulation and dynamic process model",
    "Content": "This course will start with a fast recap of development and design of single loop control using feedforward and feedback with PID control. Special emphasis will be given to controller tuning and troubleshooting of poor performance before delving into control systems instrumentation, Distributed Control System (DSC) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, data communication protocols and process historians.\n\nFollowing this, the course will introduce the plantwide challenges for control systems and discuss different approached for process optimization in both continuous and batch manufacturing systems and the implications for this type of production planning at the control and operation level.\n\nIn the last part of the course method for multivariable and model-based control are introduced and special focus is given to control of bioreactors in batch and fed-batch operation.",
