    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course will try to understand, analyze and evaluate cases on the strategic and organizational challenges and dilemmas facing pharmaceutical companies when they roll out activities in developing countries. In particular, the focus will be on how pharmaceutical companies try to reach the poorest and most vulnerable segments in developing countries and what specific challenges they face in this regard. During the course we will try to understand and analyze how pharmaceutical companies measure and communicate on their impact in developing countries, including social return on investment (SROI), ESG reporting and the SDG´s. We will analyze which partnership models work most effectively in developing countries and how contextual factors influence on the economic, social and environmental effectiveness of different partnership models. As access to care increasingly rely on digital solutions and on the use of technology in facilitating access to products and services, the course will zoom in on the kinds of technologies that support sustainable business models and philanthropic activities best,\n\nThe course takes point of departure in literature on International Business, Sustainable Business Models, impact investment and finance, technology and corporate philanthropy as well as research undertaken by faculty during 2022/2023.\n\nThe course will provide insights from a number of pharmaceutical companies operating in developing countries. In particular, cases and evidence from the Novo Nordisk-Roche partnerhip on CDiC will be used extensively, and practitioners from Novo Nordisk and Roche will participate in the course.\n\nThe course is an innovative collaboration between DTU, CBS and Novo Nordisk under the EuroTeq framework, with guest lecturers from Novo Nordisk being actively involved and allowing students from different backgrounds coming together and benefiting from diverse perspectives.",
