    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe goal of this course is to provide you with hands-on experience in the experimental techniques used for polymer microfabrication and characterization, as well as to give you sufficient background to choose the most suitable techniques for a given application. You will be introduced to fast prototyping techniques such as laser ablation and 3D printing, and to mass fabrication methods such as injection molding. You will analyze a real-world microsystems problem and propose a polymer prototype solution of your own design. You will learn to plan and carry out experiments in advanced laboratories, with focus on safe working procedures. You will also visit Danish polymer processing companies to establish your network with relevant industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the basics of polymer chemistry and physics relevant for polymer microfabrication and microsystems\nExplain the methods and the mode of operation of the equipment used\nApply selected methods to produce a polymer microsystem\nAnalyze a problem relating to polymer microsystems\nIdentify advantages and drawbacks of fabrication methods for polymer microsystems\nPropose a polymer prototype solution to a given real-world problem\nDesign a process flow diagram for the fabrication of a polymer microsystem\nWrite and present a critical report on the work process and the obtained results",
    "Content": "This course is built around a set of real-world problems calling for polymer microsystem solutions. The solution to each problem will require both polymer fabrication and characterization techniques, many of them available as part of the DTU Nanolab facilities. The course will include a short theoretical introduction to explain the basic principles behind the polymer microfabrication processes. The polymer micro- and nanofabrication methods discussed in the course include soft lithography, 3D printing (from micro to macroscale), laser micromachining, hot embossing, and injection molding. Furthermore, basic characterization methods such as optical microscopy, contact angle measurements, SEM, profilometry and XPS will be introduced. The content of the course is closely associated with the research projects at DTU Nanolab that comprise practical use of polymer microtechnology.",
