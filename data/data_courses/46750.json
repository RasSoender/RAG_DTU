    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nOperating a complex system such as power systems requires taking decisions under uncertainty and risk, be it defining the optimal market clearing for electricity market operators, to identifying optimal bidding strategies for generators, and determining optimal control actions or investments for grid operators. Decision makers must ask: What is the best possible outcome? What actions would lead to this outcome? What are the constraints restricting these actions? Optimization theory answers these questions by providing mathematical formulations and solution methods for a variety of decision-making problems. This course introduces the students to fundamental principles and algorithms of optimization theory, and shows them how to apply them to relevant decision-making problems in power systems. The knowledge acquired through this course can be applied to any real-life decision making process, e.g. devise the optimal stock portfolio for a bank, find the fastest transportation route, etc.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the fundamental principles of convex optimization and linear programming\nFormulate and explain the dual problem and KKT optimality conditions of a linear and convex optimization problem\nRecognize the structure of various decision-making problems for power systems operation and planning, in terms of input data, decisions, objective and constraints, and formulate them as mathematical optimization problems\nDescribe and identify the suitability of different solution algorithms for large-scale optimization problems, and apply them to solve efficiently specific decision-making problems in power systems\nDescribe and compare the different methods of optimization under uncertainty in terms of input data, problem structure (objective, constraints, decision variables), and computational complexity\nSolve, analyze and interpret the solutions of decision-making problems in power systems, such as the Economic Dispatch, Unit Commitment, and Optimal Power Flow problems\nOrganize, plan, and carry out work collaboratively in a group\nAnalyze, structure and present results to a broad audience\nProvide clear and constructive peer feedback",
    "Content": "This course focuses on how to take optimal decisions that deal with both the economic and the technical aspects of power systems operation. We learn how to identify the structure of specific decision-making problems for power systems operation and planning, in terms of input data, decisions, objective and constraints, formulate them as mathematical optimization problems, and solve them efficiently.\n\nThe applications studied in this course include the Economic Dispatch, Unit Commitment, and Optimal Power Flow problems, which aim at finding optimal device settings and energy flows in the power system.\n\nOn the theoretical side, this course will provide a toolbox of optimization techniques including convex and linear optimization, LP and Lagrange duality, single- and multi-stage stochastic programming, and decomposition algorithms for large-scale optimization problems.",
