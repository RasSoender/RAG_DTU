    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn order to support the understanding of colloid systems as well as interfacial phenomena in multiphase systems the participants learn about relevant types of measurements. These systems are highly complex and experimental investigation and testing is very common in companies that produce colloid products and products that are based on interfacial phenomena. This is true for the paint, food, pharmaceutical, and many other industries. The overall objective of the course is to give the participants an understanding of a range of phenomena within colloid and surface chemistry with the use of experimental methods of industrial importance.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nperform different types of measurements on colloid systems\njudge the relevance og different experimental methods for colloid systems\ncombine qualitative observations and quatitative measurements for characterization of colloid systems\ncharacterize colloid systems with respect to stability\nperform measurements of different interfacial phenomena\njudge the revance of different methods for measuring interfacial phenomena\nmeasure sureface and interfacial tension\ndescribe capillarity in porous materials from a combination of measurements\noral and written reporting of scientific data.",
    "Content": "In small teams the participants carry out approximately 5 exercises within the topics: Colloids (including dispersions, macromolecular solutions and micelles) and surfaces. Through independent exercises combined with relevant literature the possibilities and limitations for different measuring techniques. The exercises are closely linked to ongoing research. Among the topics that the exercises can cover are a.o. emulsion stability, capillarity, surface tension, contact angle, micro emulsion, interfacial tension, rheology and solubilization. Reports are prepared on all exercises. Finally, there is a common presentation and discussion session, where we will discuss each exercise.",
    "Remarks": "The course is normally taken immediately after the course 28315",
