    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to enable students to analyse protein structure and function for the purpose of understanding of disease-related mutations and rational design. This includes practical computer exercises dealing with construction and validation of models of proteins for which no experimental structure is available, as this allows prediction of biological properties of novel proteins.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nreproduce the 20 natural amino acids and account for their structural and chemical properties\ndescribe the basic protein structure elements and their properties\nevaluate the quality of experimental and model structures.\nnavigate PDB database and operate the basic functions of the program PyMOL for visualisation of protein structure.\nconstruct models of a protein of unknown structure and analyze them.\npredict the effect of point mutations on the interaction with ligands, conformational changes and other structural properties.\ndesign and develop a scientific article and learn principles for peer-review.\nlearning the basics of working with command-line tools.",
    "Content": "Protein structure from primary to quaternary, experimental determination of protein structures, structural genomics, prediction of secondary structure, accessibility etc, fold recognition, homology and de novo modelling, structure validation, protein structure analysis, protein engineering, molecular dynamics simulations.",
    "Remarks": "The project work at the end of the course is performed in small, self-elected groups with members from different expertises/background and completed with scientific articles.\n\nThe hand-in exercises (2) deal mainly with protein structure visualisation using the program PyMOL. The models will be predicted with HHPred and AlphaFold2. The mutational scans will be performed using FoldX and similar tools. For part of the exercises and in the project work, we will work on a Linux Cluster using the terminal and command-line based software.",
