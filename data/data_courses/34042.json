    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nWatch our video: https://youtu.be/9j8WOR1LS7Q\n\nQuantum photonics is now ready to be transferred from research labs to innovative and useful technologies. This course is set up to address this challenge and has three main objectives:\n\n1. To prepare the student for the technology of tomorrow in information transfer — the Quantum Internet.\n\n2. To equip the student with basic and advanced knowledge about this technological platform:\n— Fundamentals of quantum information transfer\n— Quantum communication protocols — from the most promising solutions to the latest inventions\n— Major challenges in the field\n\n3. To give the student hands-on experience with the key experiments that reveal the nature of quantum physics:\n— Quantum light source\n— Two-photon interference\n— Quantum entanglement",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the concept and the advantages of a quantum information network, including several modern implementation approaches.\nExplain coherence and decoherence in quantum systems, including semiconductor based two-level systems.\nDescribe & Operate single-photon sources and single-photon detectors.\nExplain the main quantum communication protocols, including discrete variable and continuous variable systems with a focus on multidimensional quantum systems.\nIdentify & Describe the major challenges in field, including quantum hacking and long distance communication with quantum repeaters.\nUse state-of-the-art equipment and techniques for quantum photonics experiments, including single-photon correlation measurements, two-photon interference and quantum key distribution.\nAnalyze experimental data and draw conclusions.\nEvaluate critically the presented topics from a scientific point of view.",
    "Content": "The course will be composed of:\n\n— Lectures on the state-of-the-art in optical communication, introduction to quantum optics and quantum networks, quantum state transfer, quantum coherence, and decoherence, single-photon sources and detectors, quantum cryptography, and quantum error correction.\n\n— Student seminars on the topic, for instance, on specific quantum communication protocols. The actual subjects will be discussed and defined together with the students during the course.\n\n— Laboratory experiments on fundamentals of quantum physics, which until recently could only be done in research labs.",
