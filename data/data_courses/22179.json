    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to teach the students how to create value our of new discoveries and innovations.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nestimate the novelty of a new discovery in an IPR perspective.\ndecide if patenting is the optimal way to obtain value of a new discovery.\njudge the economic potential of a new discovery.\nestimate the resource saving or result promoting potential of a new discovery.\ndecide the optimal way of creating value of a new discovery.\nwrite an implementation plan of a novel discovery.\npresent the implementation plan for external stakeholders in order to get feedback.\ninteract efficiently in a team work during the project writing process.",
    "Content": "The course will use the results obtained by the participants during their Master education or projects as examples. The participants will be introduced to general Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) theory with special focus on the bio/pharma area. The course participants will further be introduced to different views on value creation and how to evaluate the potential of inventions and discoveries in industrial-/commercial- as well as research contexts, with the use of examples from the real world.\nThe participants will be introduced to the basics of creating a funding plan but also how to estimate and describe the value of implementing new discoveries or improved processes. The participants will later work in groups and use an innovation or discovery obtained during one of the group participants master thesis results as their object of interest.\n\nThe participants must evaluate the potential of the given object and the end result must be a plan of how to obtain value of the given object. This can be either in the form of a spin-out company or other means. Another option is a report that describes how the discovery can otherwise create value. In all cases the final report must contain a plan of implementation with milestones, resources needed (a draft budget) and expected benefits in a timeline view. The participants will be expected to take personal contact to potential stakeholders, not previously approached, in order to get feedback on their thoughts, and document the outcome.\nAll students must propose a project on the first day. Groups of 4-5 students will be formed according to the students' selection of the most interesting projects.",
    "Remarks": "Ideally, you have defended your master thesis project in Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Biotechnology or equivalent educations.\nIf you have not started or completed your project, you are still welcome to join the course.\n\nPlease note that all students should have a \"case\" to eventually use as a course project. This case can be the master project, a new invention or any project/idea with commercial potential.\nIf you are uncertain whether your \"case\" is acceptable, please contact the course coordinators before registration.\n\nMake sure that your supervisors are aware that you will present the case in a classroom and, especially if you come from industry, make sure to have a written confirmation that you can use such a case (by email, for example).\nIf you do not have a case to present, you will be asked to give a preference on which projects you would like to work with.",
