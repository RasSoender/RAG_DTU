    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with an applied knowledge of the basic processes which are important in the production and distribution of drinking water and of water for the industry, to theoretically analyse the operation of a ground water treatment plant, and to plan, design and analyse urban water distribution systems, using both simple hand calculations and professional computer software. Water supply is considered from a holistic point of view from the resources to the consumer.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe and contrast the quality demands for different uses of water - from drinking water to water for the industry\nExplain and evaluate microbiological and chemical water quality parameters with respect to how they affect water safety\nDescribe and evaluate hygienic aspects of water production and distribution and explain the governing factors in applying disinfection\nDescribe the most important processes in water treatment at water works and contrast their advantages and disadvantages\nCalculate and predict the changes in the concentration of the chemical species through a water works using hand calculations and\nAnalyse theoretically the operation of a ground water treatment plant by the use of professional computer software\nCalculate the system requirements of a water distribution network for a small town (flow, pressure, fire fighting, time variations)\nPlan, design optimize and analyse urban water distribution systems, using both simple hand calculations and professional computer ware\nDescribe and explain the principles in the legislation, control and management structure of supplying water\nIdentify and discuss the limitations and opportunities of using professional computer software in practical civil engineering contexts\nProduce technical reports clearly documenting the use and the obtained results of using professional computer software for analyzing water works and distribution networks",
    "Content": "The spectrum of water qualities in water resources and the various quality requirements according to the use of the water will be reviewed together with the amount and variation of water consumption, hygiene and water quality. The course will also deal with the chemical and biological processes in treatment of surface and ground water for and in distribution systems, including processes in domestic water installations. Water works operation will be analyzed based on modelling of a number of physical-chemical parameters. Besides the treatment of water, the distribution system is considered, since it is the most expensive part of the water supply system, and the course involves planning, design and analysis of pumping installations, reservoirs and distribution networks. The interaction between the water and the construction material is an essential part of the processes in distribution systems. Lectures are presenting the theory of the course. In parallel to the lectures the participants work in groups with structured exercises: initially by modelling of water treatment processes and finally by modelling of distribution networks. Last year's lecture plan can be obtained from the course responsible, Hans-Jørgen Albrechtsen (hana@dtu.dk).",
