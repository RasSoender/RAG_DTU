    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nQuantum effects such as quantum superposition and entanglement are now being used to develop radically new technologies with far-reaching applications, including super-secure communication, a new paradigm for computing (quantum computing), and sensors with unprecedented sensitivity based e.g. on color centers in diamond. This is a true technological revolution and thus companies, like Google and Microsoft, are investing substantially in this new technology.\n\nThe goal of this course is to experimentally explore some of these technologies with focus on quantum optical technology. This includes an understanding of the production, the detection and the characterization of quantum states. A special focus will be put on how to deal with unavoidable technical noise sources, present in all implementations, which disturb quantum effects.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nTransform elements of quantum theory into practical quantum technology\nDiagnose and evaluate technical imperfections in experiments\nIdentify, design and implement optimal data analysis strategies\nExplain the different techniques used in a particular quantum technology\nDiscuss experiments in quantum optics\nOrganize, plan and carry out collaborative work in group projects\nPresent and defend experimental work\nDocument experimental lab work",
    "Content": "The course offers to implement and investigate applications of quantum technology. Working in groups the students will pick a particular quantum technology, study the theory behind it and plan its implementation considering various imperfections. After a detailed characterization of the components that shall be used the group will finally implement it.\n\nDepending on the chosen technology the following topics may be studied:\n- Single photons from parametric down-conversion sources\n- Single photon detectors\n- coherent states\n- homodyne detection of continuous variables\n- Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment\n- Hanbury-Brown-Twiss experiment\n- Violation of Bell inequality with entanglement\n- Quantum interferometry\n- Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)\n\nSpecial emphasis will be put on technical details an experimentalist has to deal with when demonstrating theoretical quantum optical predictions and when making use of those in practical measurement devices. The student is, thus, introduced to cutting-edge technological challenges faced by quantum engineers.",
    "Course literature": "Relevant literature will be included according to the particular need of each individual project group. There is no fixed curriculum for the course.",
