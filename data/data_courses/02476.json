    "Danish title": "Machine Learning Operations",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nGeneral competence course (MSc), Autonomous Systems\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Autonomous Systems\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Technology Entrepreneurship",
    "Schedule": "January",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The course includes lectures, exercises and project work. The lectures are short and provide context for why each topic is important. The main focus is on exercises with emphasis on practical tools and coding skills for machine learning in production. Finally, approximately 30% of the course is spent on project work in groups of 3-5 persons, where tools used throughout the course should be applied on a self-chosen machine learning problem.",
