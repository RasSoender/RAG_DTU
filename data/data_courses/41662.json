    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nBy means of advanced teaching and self-education in the fundamentals of the physical, physical-chemical and physical-mechanical metallurgy, the student will be able to understand the (trans)formation of the microstructure of metals in metallurgical processes for metallic crystalline and amorphous materials.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nevaluate the impact of mechanical, chemical and thermal mechanisms on microstructure evolution in metals and alloys\nexplain the construction of phase diagrams in terms of the thermodynamic principles, i.e. Gibbs energy curves\nreproduce the principles of diffusion (driving force and its mechanisms) in binary systems\npredict single crystal deformation and lattice rotations\nmodel work-hardening stages in correlation with the deformation-induced microstructures\nanalyze interactions between dislocations and other lattice defects based on their stress fields\napply binary phase diagrams to interpret microstructure changes in metals and alloys\nexplain the various stages of phase transformations in terms of the thermodynamic and kinetic principles\nexplain the difference between diffusion controlled, interface controlled and martensitic phase transformations\nassess the effect of microstructural restoration mechanisms on the strength of metals and alloys\nanalyze a recent scientific metallurgical article by application of the course contents and identify the principal mechanisms responsible for microstructure evolution\ndefend a scientific interpretation against an alternative interpretation in a oral discussion",
    "Content": "Thermodynamic and kinetic basis for phase transformations in metallic materials. Distinction is made between martensitic, diffusion controlled and interface controlled phase transformations. Thermodynamic background for phase diagrams; energy contribution of point defects, interfaces and strain, plastic deformation and slip, dislocation-defect interaction and strengthening/hardening, microstructure evolution during plastic deformation and annealing. The contents of the course are adapted after consultation of the participating students and through individual literature investigation. Active discussions on various scientific interpretations are part of the teaching form.",
