    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo establish a solid understanding of the physical and technological background for optical waveguides and components for the control of a broad spectrum of light, from the visible to THz frequencies. Optical circuits are expected to become of great importance for future engineers within areas such as telecommunication, sensors and computer architecture. Optical fibers already play a crucial role within long-distance signal transmission, and are increasingly used as sensors, in laser systems, and for signal processing. This course gives a thorough understanding of optical fibers, an introduction to integrated optical and plasmonic circuits, and a discussion of elementary THz technology. The course constitutes a solid platform for further work (e.g. masters projects) within these fields.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the structure of modal fields in in optical fibres with a parabolic index profile, and write down expressions for the intermodal dispersion.\nEstimate the number of guided modes in step-index optical fibers, as well as dispersion, effective area and bend loss, for given values of core radius and index contrast.\nDescribe the structure, guidance mechanisms and applications of photonic crystal fibers, write down the single-mode criterion and estimate dispersion and effective area for standard index-guiding crystal fibers.\nDescribe the structure, modal fields, propagation losses and applications of various types of hollow-core fibers.\nDiscuss prism- and grating-assisted coupling of light to surface plasmon polaritons, as well as prism-assisted beamsplitting in the THz regime.\nDerive equations for reflection and transmission in fiber-integrated Bragg gratings. Sketch solutions for uniform Bragg gratings, as well as chirped and apodized gratings.\nSet up full vectorial equations for electromagnetic waves in optical fibers. Describe the weak-guidance approximation, and the scaling laws it entails.\nFormulate equations controlling the incoupling of light in waveguides. Use modal coefficient formalism to argue for symmetry conservation in tapers.\nDerive coupled-mode equations for directional couplers, and sketch their solutions. Describe the dependence of the coupling coefficient on the waveguide structure.\nDescribe the properties of surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). Set up the wave equation describing SPP, and outline the dispersion diagram for SPP waves at air/metal interfaces.\nDescribe waveguidance of broadband signals in the THz range,the properties of dispersion-free as well as dispersive metallic waveguides, and loss mechanisms for THz waves in waveguides.",
    "Content": "Starting from Maxwell's equations, the fundamental principles for localization and manipulation of light are established. Dielectric waveguides, their geometries and mutual coupling, will be discussed. Furthermore, plasmonic waveguides and metallic waveguides for THz radiation are introduced. The course gives an introduction to the building blocks of optical circuits, such as passive waveguides, Bragg gratings and couplers. Microstructured optical fibers and their bandgap effects are also introduced. The course contains excursions to danish companies, thus giving a good impression of the ongoing activities within the field.",
