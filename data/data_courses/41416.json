    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give the students a background for analyzing, designing and optimizing both modern energy plants and their operation in energy systems.\nThe covered sectors for integration of new technologies are electricity, heating, cooling, and fuels, emphasizing sustainable solutions and renewable energy sources..\n\nThe course focuses on performance optimization of power plants, combined heat and power plants, heat pumps, and refrigeration systems involving thermal, mechanical and chemical energy conversion. This optimization aims to enable the green transition of the energy supply, distribution, and use in domestic and industrial sectors. Both energy, economy and emissions are considered as criteria for evaluations.\n\nIn addition the students will obtain knowledge about construction and operation of energy systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nFormulate mathematical models for an energy system and apply these to outline the system characteristics\nDemonstrate comprehensive understanding of the interaction between markets and technologies in the energy system\nDescribe and evaluate a number of visions for future solutions for the energy system\nEvaluate and quantify energy and economy consequences of implementing new technologies in the energy system\nDescribe and evaluate different energy storage technologies with respect to the process in which they are installed\nDo pinch analysis for heat recovery systems\nDo exergy analysis of an energy plant\nPredict the economic feasibility of a project, and perform an exergoeconomic analysis of the technology to improve it\nSynthesize and document proposals for optimal design and operating strategy of an energy plant\nDevelop dynamic models of thermal systems to optimize operation",
    "Content": "The course deals with energy supply systems on a national as well as a regional level such as systems for supply of electricity, systems for supply of heat. Plants for production, transport, and storage of secondary energy will be described. Characteristic properties and limitations of such plants will be discussed and related to variations of consumer demand with time.\nMethods for analysis and design of such complex plants and systems and optimization of their operation are introduced. The technical systems are both analyzed by traditional thermodynamic analyses and modern methods as pinch and exergy analysis. The technical analyses are integrated with traditional economic methods by the combined techno-economic method \"exergoeconomics\"",
