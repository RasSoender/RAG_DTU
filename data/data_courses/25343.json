    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis advanced statistics course aims to enable the students\nto draw inference from models which are not\ncovered by linear model routines in standard statistical\nsoftware packages. Such non-standard models\nare very common in natural resource modelling and\ncould e.g. contain: non-trivial non-linearities, complex\ncovariance structures, complicated couplings between\nfixed and random effects, or different sources of\nobservations needing different likelihood types. In addition\nthey could contain large amounts of data. By\nthe end of the course the students should be able to\nformulate (on paper and in code) non-standard models,\nestimate model parameters from these, quantify\nuncertainties, and test model hypothesis.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nClassify if a model is non-standard (meaning that it not easily can be fitted by standard statistical software packages).\nImplement non-standard models for different data types via custom written efficient likelihood code\nFormulate non-standard models in clear text including model assumptions.\nEstimate model parameters of models including both fixed and random effects.\nImplement models based on efficient representations of the multivariate normal\nQuantify uncertainties of estimated and derived quantities of interest.\nUse and draw correct conclusions from appropriate diagnostics measures\nClearly formulate the result of an analysis of data by a non-standard model (estimates, uncertainties, and hypothesis testing).",
    "Content": "This advanced statistics course deals with nonstandard\nmodels, which are models that are not possible\nto analyze via pre-written code in standard statistical\nsoftware packages. The analysis of non-standard\nrequire the analysts to explicitly write efficient code\nfor the likelihood function of the problem and optimize\nthe likelihood, which require use of modern techniques\nfor automatic calculation of derivatives. These\ntools will be taught and studied. In addition to the\ntechnical side of things a lot of emphasis will be put\non model-formulation, on drawing correct conclusions\nfrom the models and on validating that appropriate\nmodels are being applied. Among the types of models\nthat will be studied are: Non-linear regression models,\ngeneral random-effects models (including state-space\nmodels), multivariate models, and models informed\nby multiple different data sources.",
