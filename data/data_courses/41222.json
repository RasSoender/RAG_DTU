    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAfter completing this course, the student should be able to use linear potential flow theory to predict the wave induced motions of floating maritime structures. An understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different numerical solution techniques will allow the student to make the appropriate choice depending on the application. The primary focus, for example applications, is on ships, offshore wind turbines and wave power devices.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExpress the equations of motion for a floating marine structure in terms of linear coefficients\nGo back and forth between the time- and frequency-domain representations of the problem\nDerive relationships between different scattering problems and their asymptotic limits\nUse Green's theorem to derive the boundary integral formulation of the problem\nDiscretize the boundary integral equation to obtain a numerical method suitable for calculations\nDecide which numerical solution technique is best suited to a particular application\nWrite a solver for the equations of motion in Matlab\nCompute the response of a floating structure in waves and compare with established benchmark solutions\nUnderstand how weakly-nonlinear effects can be incorporated into a time-domain analysis\nDescribe how nonlinear effects can be included in the analysis",
    "Content": "Starting from the basic conservation laws for a fluid flow (the Navier-Stokes equations) we derive the potential flow approximation for the hydrodynamic interaction between a fixed or floating marine structure and ocean waves. This problem is linearized, assuming small amplitude waves and small body motions, to express the structure as a linear harmonic oscillator. The relationship between the time- and frequency-domain expressions is stressed. Green's theorem is used to derive a number of useful relations between coefficients, as well as high- and low-frequency limits. Green's theorem also leads to the Boundary Integral form of the problem and further to the Boundary Element Method (BEM) which is the most widely used numerical solution technique for obtaining the hydrodynamic coefficients. A number of variants of the BEM are discussed including both 2D strip-type methods and 3D methods based on either the free-surface or the Rankine Green function. As exercises, the student will develop their own 2D, BEM solver is both for infinite fluid problems and for wave radiation and diffraction. Finite difference and finite volume solutions are also discussed. Weekly exercises are solved to illustrate the theory. A solver for the equations of motion is built in Matlab and applied to analyse several typical structures. Several short concept tests will also be given during the course of the Semester.",
