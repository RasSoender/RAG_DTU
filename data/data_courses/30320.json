More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the students to, independently, solve a complex instrumentation task based on an aerospace design proposal or a measurement principle. Typical design parameters are stringent requirements for quality, precision, lifetime, robustness, international standards and possibly specific requirements for consideration of the surroundings. The aim is that the students can use the experiences from the course in aviation and space, robotics and medical technology as well as military and other high-quality instrumentation systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndesign a instrumentation system for space use\nderive relevant design drivers from a suite of requirements\nderive an adequate design from mission specification and drivers\nanalyse and rank different designs with respect to PA aspects\nanalyse and rank different designs with respect to QA aspects\nanalyse a given instrument with respect to relevant consumables for the application\nanalyse and quantify the design arrived with respect to performance\noptimize the achieved design wrt. robustness and autonomy of operation\noptimize the chosen design wrt. choise of components and parts vis-a-vis the space environment\noptimize a design for ruggedness wrt. launch and space operation\ndesign a test and verification strategy for the chosen design.",
    "Content": "The course is sectioned into two parts: The lecture hours, where the theory, standards and methods are taught, and a laboratory part, where teams of students form study groups that solve design assignments within space instrumentation.\n\nThese assignments are all derived from the international satellite projects in which the department participates, why it is the intention that the designs are to be used for later missions. Therefore, the assignments include both system engineering, robustness and space-hardening aspects, as well as instrumentation aspects.\n\nSince the methods, norms and the working process are general for high-performance systems, the course not only provides competence within aerospace, but also for other high-performance instrumentation systems, e.g. within medical technology.",
    "Remarks": "At the start of the semester, the students will be presented with a problem complex, i.e., that year's topic. The students will be asked to form teams that together cover the field in such a way that the problem complex is well covered. Each student will join a team based on experience, personal preferences, education and skills.",
