    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will teach the application and evaluation of assays used in the chain from discovery to clinical use of (bio)pharmaceuticals with emphasis on how and why different assays are used at specific steps in the pipeline. Basic assay principles, concepts and statistics for validation and development of assays and for evaluation of results will be discussed, and various types of equipment and technologies used for assay measurements will be presented. The laboratory exercises will demonstrate the use, practical execution, and analysis of examples of assays.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the basic immunoassay principles and methods (incl ELISA), quantitative as well as qualitative\nexplain how to perform quantitative immunoassays (ELISA) and explain the different formats available\ndescribe the principles and uses of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different formats, including quantitative PCR (qPCR)\ndescribe the basic principles of flow cytometry and assays based on this method\nexplain how quantitative assays are validated\nexplain and discuss the principles of signal generation and signal detection in assays\nperform immunoassays and qPCR- and flow cytometry-based assays practically in the laboratory\nanalyse and present data from experimental assays (immunoassay, qPCR, and flow cytometry)\nexplain the basic principles in analysis of assay data and the statistical parameters that are used in the analysis\napply the knowledge obtained in the course to select or suggest improvements to assays for specific analyses, for instance different steps in the pharma process",
    "Content": "This course will provide the basic concepts for evaluating and validating assay performance, and how different types of assays can be used to analyze different types of samples. In addition, the principles and applications of different types of assays will be demonstrated, including immuno-based assays, cellular assays (flow cytometry), and quantitative molecular biology-based assays (PCR type assays). Signal generation methods including fluorescence and chemiluminescence will also be explained. Finally, the principles behind the selection and application of different assays in the process from discovery to the clinical use of pharmaceuticals will be discussed.",
    "Remarks": "Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering students have priority as this course is mandatory (specialization) for these students.\n\nThe participants have to bring their own lab coat and safety glasses!",
