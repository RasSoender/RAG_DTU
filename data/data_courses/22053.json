    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective is to obtain basic understanding of Brain Computer Interface (BCI: Computer-based systems that record, decode and translate measurable neurophysiological signals into commands for output devices to perform an action without any muscular activation). This is achieved by incorporating real-time signal processing methods for the feature extraction and classification in EEG (electroencephalography)-based BCIs.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the EEG signals that can be detected as markers of mental activity.\ndescribe different BCI systems and neural prostheses.\napply signal processing techniques to condition the EEG signals.\ndevelop methods for extracting relevant features.\nimplement classification algorithms to classify these signals.\nbuild a functioning BCI system.\nreview and present selected scientific articles.\ndiscuss the developments and the future of this field.",
    "Content": "Brain-Computer Interface based on different types of EEGs will be covered in the form of lectures, discussions, practical and theoretical learning methods. The students will be asked to present a scientific article. A BCI design group project (group of 2) using the available BCI data or new data will be completed with a final report and a presentation.",
