    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall aim of the course is to give the students a comprehensive overview of: i) the different types of complex small organic molecules (secondary metabolites = natural products) that microorganisms, algae and plants can biosynthesize; ii) the different types of unique enzymes that catalyzes their biosynthesis; iii) the nature of the underlying gene clusters, and iv) how bioinformatics tools can be used to link genes to chemical structures and vice versa.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand and explain the nature of biosynthesis of polyketides.\nUnderstand and explain the nature of biosynthesis of ribosomal and non-ribosomal peptides.\nUnderstand and explain the nature of terpenoids and compounds of mixed biosynthetic origin.\nPredict the composition of the related gene cluster, in bacteria and fungi, based on structural analysis of a given natural product.\nUnderstand and be able to implement bioinformatic tools, such as antiSMASH, for analysis of secondary metabolite gene clusters,\nUnderstand the basic principles behinad the use of bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, HMMer, Interproscan for prediction of related enzyme activities.\nUnderstand and explain the nature of polyketide syntases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases including their domain structures.\nPredict different types of natural products and their biosynthesis based on genome analysis.",
    "Content": "Advanced understanding in biosynthesis of complex natural products, such as polyketides, bioactive ribosomal and non-ribosomal peptides, terpenoids and compounds of mixed biosynthetic origin. Use of bioinformatic tools such as antiSMASH, BLAST, and other tools for annotation of genes, gene clusters, and prediction of the nature of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of natural products.\nImportantly, this course is directed towards both biotech students, as well as students interested in organic chemistry, who want to strengthen their biochemical knowledge.",
