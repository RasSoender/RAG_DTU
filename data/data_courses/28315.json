    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis introductory master course presents colloid and surface chemistry. The course deals with important principles and phenomena related to colloid systems and surface chemistry. These subjects are fundamental to the understanding and design of a range of processes like e.g. adhesion, lubrication, cleaning, oil recovery, water and air purification. Furthermore the subjects are essential for the application and design of a number of chemical products like e.g. paint, glue, detergents, cosmetics, drugs and foods. In this way the course contributes to the understanding of the development of sustainable chemical products and associated processes. Finally, the course offers understanding of several naturally occurring phenomena like e.g. fog, rain drops, the capillary effect the red sunset, the blue sky and the rainbow, and beer foam.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nevaluate and describe colloidal nano-technological and chemical systems, processes and products\nuse different theories to calculate surface and interfaces tensions and use this to estimate e.g. wetting and other system characteristics\nidentify mechanisms for adhesion between surfaces and materials and use different methods to estimate this\ndescribe the most important and fundamental theories in surface chemistry\nexplain micellation of surfactants, know how to measure this and calculate dependencies of salt concentration, system temperature and surfactant chain length\ncompare and understand adsorption in gas-liquid and solid-liquid surfaces and perform quantitative adsorption calculations\ncalculate molar mass and molecular shape of colloid particles and polymers based on experimental data\ndescribe the interactions between colloidal particles and identify similarities and differences for the governing molecular forces and interactions\nexplain the most important parameters for the theories of colloidal interaction and perform calculations using the theories\ndescribe the conditions for stability of colloidal systems and discuss and compare different mechanisms for stabilization\ndescribe mechanisms for stabilization of emulsions and foam, and design emulsions and foam by using various semi-empirical methods",
