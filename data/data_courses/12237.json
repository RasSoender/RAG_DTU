    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide a general basic knowledge of environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology as a fundamental basis for understanding chemical pollution problems. Tools for evaluation of environmental fate and effects of chemicals are introduced in the context of environmental management and risk assessment.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine and describe fundamental concepts and terms in environmental toxicology, chemistry and risk assessment\nCollect relevant chemical fate and effect data from the internet and handbooks/databases\nInterpret physico-chemical data for chemicals in relation to environmental fate\nQuantify environmental behavior using equilibrium assumptions\nApply simple quantitative structure activity relationships in the estimation of inherent compound properties\nInterpret results of standardized biodegradability tests\nConduct laboratory ecotoxicity test with chemicals\nAnalyse data and evaluate results of ecotoxicological tests\nDescribe test results in a technical laboratory report\nClassify and assess chemicals in accordance with regulatory guidelines for environmental risk assessment\nSummarize and evaluate own and literature data in environmental profiles of organic chemicals",
    "Content": "The course deals with environmental exposure and effect assessment of organic chemicals. Exposure and effect assessments are key elements in both Danish and EU classifications and risk assessments of chemicals. The exposure assessment covers the environmental chemical fate i.e. transport, degradation, intermedia transfer and partitioning of chemicals in different parts of the environment. Here processes like biodegradation, hydrolysis, photodegradation, sorption, volatilization, and bioaccumulation are fundamental for understanding the environmental behaviour of chemicals. The processes are related to the physico-chemical and chemical structure properties and to the characteristics of the environmental compartments (water, aquatic sediments, aquatic biota, soil, and air). Calculation exercises and computer-based models for distribution of compounds are used to illustrate the environmental chemical fate. The effect assessment covers ecotoxicological effects of chemicals. This subject is taught through lectures dealing with the theoretical aspects of toxicity testing and regulatory use of toxicity data. Furthermore, collection of chemical property data and a series of theoretical and practical laboratory exercises are carried out in groups of 3 students. The laboratory exercises include standard tests for biodegradation and biological effects on different groups of organisms (e.g. bacteria, algae and crustaceans).",
    "Course literature": "As teaching materials is used a \"Set of notes\" composed by teachers own notes supplemented with relevant literature.",
