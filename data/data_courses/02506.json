    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give knowledge of advanced methods and models for analyzing image data, and give competence in applying these techniques in different applications. The course attempts to make the participants recognize that the use of appropriate models can extract useful knowledge from image data - knowledge that is not directly accessible.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nImplement advanced image analysis algorithms in Python.\nAssess if an implemented image analysis algorithm works correctly and gives the desired results.\nMotivate and identify the underlying assumptions of an image analysis method.\nApply machine learning methods/neural networks to image analysis problems.\nApply scale space methods, and know when this is appropriate.\nApply feature based methods to solve image analysis problems\nApply deformable template models, and estimate these from data.\nApply Markov Random Field techniques to image analysis problems.",
    "Content": "The course introduces advanced topics within image analysis, focusing on a fundamental understanding of the included image analysis techniques. Therefore, the focus of the exercises is on implementing algorithms in Python and using these for solving practical image analysis problems within the following topics: Detection of image features, scale space models, texture characterization and modeling, Markov models, neural networks, shape models, and other similar image analysis methods. Students become capable of identifying methods for solving image analysis problems, setting up test scenarios for implementing and verifying image analysis methods, and carrying out and reporting quantitative analysis.",
