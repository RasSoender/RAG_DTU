    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course, designed specifically for MSc students, provides a comprehensive exploration of radiation detection and measurement principles, as well as hard X-ray and Gamma-Ray detectors, with a special focus on their applications in scientific space instrumentation. It delves deep into the core concepts of solid-state physics, highlighting their critical role in various radiation interactions within solid-state detectors. The curriculum offers an in-depth study of the design, properties, and performance of 1D, 2D, and 3D X-ray and gamma detectors. In addition, students will conduct experiments in the laboratory using real detectors and numerical methods for instrument performance simulation with tools like SRIM and SPENVIS. Practical laboratory exercises will provide hands-on experience with cutting-edge detectors, reflecting both detector physics and theoretical aspects.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the principles of solid-state physics in radiation detection and measurement.\nDescribe various types of radiation interactions in solid-state detectors.\nConduct experimental methods for detector performance characterization.\nApply experiments using semiconductor radiation detectors to evaluate the imaging, spectral, and timing properties of detectors.\nCalculate the theoretical detector quantum efficiency and in-orbit background.\nUnderstand the designs and functionality of X- and Gamma-ray scientific space instrumentation, and evaluate the scientific capabilities of detector instruments in a space environment.\nUtilize and use radiation calibration sources.\nExplain the types of radiation in space.",
