    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give a thorough introduction to decomposition algorithms. This will enable the students to solve complex optimization problems. Furthermore the student is trained in applying the algorithms and implementing them in Julia",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand and apply linear programming duality in algorithm development.\nApply modeling software to implement iterative algortihms.\nApply the Benders decomposition algorithm.\nApply the Column Generation algorithm/Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition.\nUnderstand the correctness of Benders decompositions algorithm and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm.\nImplement of basic versions of Benders decomposition algorithm and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm.\nAnalyze a mathematical model and evaluate if it is suitable for decomposition methods.\nSummarize and explain a scientific article on advanced operation research methods.",
    "Content": "Many important optimization problems can be modeled using mixed\ninteger programming models. When these models cannot be solved using\nstandard solver software, decomposition algorithms can be applied to solve the problems iteratively. The methods are:\n- Benders decomposition\n- Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition/column generation\n\nThe course will give the students a thorough introduction to the two\ntypes of algorithms and enable to use them as solution methods for\nvarious problems.",
    "Course literature": "Scientific papers and course notes.",
    "Remarks": "The course is quantitatively oriented, and a good understanding of linear programming is necessary. In the exercises, the computer language Julia/JuMP (taught in course 42112) is used to implement the decompositions algorithms. Students without prior knowledge of Julia/JuMP should be prepared for a significant extra workload.",
