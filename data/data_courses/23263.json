    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims at providing a solid foundation in epidemiological modeling. Students will learn a wide array of techniques that can be used to analyze outbreaks and forecast the development of epidemics. The course will focus on the mathematical aspects of disease modeling and the python programming language will be used extensively.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nRecognize the terms in the SIR model and its derivatives\nAdapt a basic model to describe a given epidemic\nChoose a proper model framework given a type of outbreak\nSolve a time-dependent epidemiological model numerically\nFit model parameters to epidemiological data\nExplain the effect of noise in epidemiological data\nExplain the effects of seasonality and other driving terms\nObtain the endemic equilibrium for a given model\nCalculate the propagation speed of an epidemic using a spatial model\nAnalyze an epidemic using lattice based models",
    "Content": "Dynamical systems, analysis of stability and fixed points, non-linear dynamics and chaos. Temporal models (SIR and derivatives). Risk structures. Multi-host/multi-pathogen models. Forced models. Random dynamics and noisy models, agent-based models. Spatial models, lattice-based models and meta-populations. Disease control and prevention. Global mobility, pandemics, economic epidemiology, and antimicrobial resistance.",
