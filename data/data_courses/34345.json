    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose of the course is to illustrate the integrated operation of railway systems in regards to dispatching, signalling and interlocking and the technologies enabling it. The course aims at establishing a basic understanding of functional subsystems, technological principles and differential evolutionary technical developments, which can be applied for the evaluation and declaration of design rules, analysis and design of signalling and interlocking infrastructure elements for railways.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the interrelation between traffic management systems, signal equipment, interlocking systems and on-board train protection systems.\nClarify the safety principles in railway operations\nClarify the safety principles in signalling systems\nExplain the principles behind Train Detection (Track Clear Detection) and how it is used in signalling systems.\nDescribe the purpose and functionality of an interlocking system for a station.\nApply design rules for signalling, interlocking and train protection systems.\nAnalyse requirements and design accordingly infrastructure elements for railway signalling and interlocking in specific contexts (i.e. railway station or open line).\nExplain ERTMS and illustrate the differences from previous signalling systems.\nDescribe the principles of GSM-R (GSM-Railways) communication technology.\nAnalyse requirements for GSM-R based radio coverage, for stations or open lines, and design the necessary GSM-radio elements.\nDescribe the principles of Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) system, assessing differences and similarities with other systems (i.e. ERTMS).",
    "Content": "The course introduces the theoretical background and history of railway signalling systems. The theoretical part of the course introduces the signal equipment, interlocking systems and their instrumental relation to traffic control. Different types of signalling systems will be introduced, including The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and the Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC). During the course and correlated with the theoretical presentations, focus will be put on the design and evaluation of signalling systems through periodic required exercises. The course will include guest-lecturers from operators and industry. A field trip (to study infrastructure elements and traffic control) could be integrated in the plan, but can not be guaranteed a priori, since it depends on external stakeholders possibilities.",
