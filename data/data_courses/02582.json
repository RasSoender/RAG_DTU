    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the student knowledge of advanced computer intensive data analysis methods with applications to e.g. life sciences. These include problems with many variables and relatively few observations, images etc. The am is to give the student to analytically as well as based on computational results evaluate data analysis methods.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEvaluate clustering methods and select suitable parameters and models for given data\nEvaluate linear discriminant analysis and ridge regression\nEvaluate cross validation, bootstrapping and concepts such as overfitting.\nEvaluate sparse regression and classification models.\nEvaluate logistic regression and support vector classifiers for 2 class problems\nEvaluate and interpret Classification and Regression Trees (CART).\nEvaluate bagging, boosting and random forests for classification and regression.\nEvaluate and interpret sparse latent methods such as sparse principal component and sparse partial least squares.\nEvaluate a range of unsupervised decomposition methods\nCompare the mentioned methods theoretically",
    "Content": "Methods: Clustering, ridge regression, elastic net, sparse principal components, sparse discriminant analysis and Gaussian mixture analysis, logistic regression, support vector machine, classification and regression trees, bagging, boosting, random forests, nonnegative matrix factorization, independent component analysis, sparse coding, archetypical analysis, multivay methods, functional data analysis.\nCase studies: Varies each year.",
