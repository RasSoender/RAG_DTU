    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objectives of the course are to APPLY knowledge of general and important clinical and technical aspects as well as tools for solving tasks. The tasks deal with regulatory documentation requirements for medicotechnical product development, failure analysis, testing, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service support as well as treatment and assessment of health risks in the event of product defects on the European and American markets.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nconduct comprehensive evaluations and provide in-depth, constructive feedback on biomedical product designs, considering trends in technology, domestic regulatory requirements, and market factors.\noutline a cross functional developing team based on a given biomedical product, design a product development plan and insert relevant critical milestones in a time schedule plan.\nidentify and specify technical and clinical quality safety issues regarding requirements and needs of a given biomedical product.\napply the QFD (Quality Function Deployment) model to translate customer needs and expectations to product specifications for a given biomedical product.\nrisk assessment methods for example FMEA (failure mode & effect analysis) and FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) to evaluate general health hazard risks (health hazard evaluation) for biomedical products based on clinical and technical as well as regulatory requirements\nevaluate and address high failure rates of certain components by calculating e.g., MTFB (Mean Time Between Failure) of different biomedical products in relation to the reliability needs of such components.\napply principles of human factors and address limitations in designing biomedical systems and equipment, ensuring they operate efficiently, safely, effectively, and reliably while minimizing environmental impact and fostering sustainability.\napply industry-standard methods to verify and validate technical design parameters and performance data for a designated medical device, ensuring its reliability, safety, and efficacy in real-world settings.\nset up technical quality assurance features operating a given biomedical product in use.\ndemonstrate knowledge of various regulatory demands and requirements related to marketing and selling biomedical products in the US (FDA) and Europe (MDR).\ndesign a simple CAPA-system (Corrective and Preventive Actions) dealing with customer complaints and risk assessment regarding biomedical products on the market in relation to regulatory issues.",
    "Content": "The course uses knowledge of general and important clinical and technical aspects as well as tools for solving tasks. The tasks deals with regulatory documentation requirements for medicotechnical product development, failure analysis, testing, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service support as well as treatment and assessment of health risks in the event of product defects on the European and American markets.\n\nThe course is a continuation of the mandatory course 22449 \"Introduction to medicotechnical product development\" with a special focus on being able to apply the concepts that were introduced.",
