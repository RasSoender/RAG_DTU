    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the sky observed with astronomical instruments and compare the wide range of astrophysical sources of electromagnetic radiations\ndistinguish the astrophysical processes that produce high energy emission, and relate them to the variety of X-ray sources\nexplain the physical mechanisms involved at different stages of stellar evolution for different stellar masses\nIdentify and describe causes of stellar variability and their observable effects\nderive and compare the fundamental properties of compact objects (white dwarves, neutron stars and black holes) and their creation as the last stages of stellar evolution\nderive and compare the properties of the X-ray binaries and the basic physics involved in accretion mechanisms\ndescribe transient phenomena associated with stellar explosions and mergers of compact objects, including supernovae and gamma-ray bursts\ndescribe the phenomena that occur in the center of active galaxies\nexplain and exploit X-ray observations of clusters of galaxies.\nutilize theory to quantify astrophysical properties, such as luminosity, flux, temperature, mass, distance, etc.\npresent, summarize and interpret relevant scientific articles",
    "Content": "This course deals with some of the Universe's most energetic objects and phenomena. It goes deep into different phases of stellar evolution and related variability, such as stellar oscillations.\nThe course gives further explanations of highly energetic astrophysical phenomena through their observational properties, such as temporal and spectral variations. Examples are supernova remnants, accretion mechanisms around white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in X-ray binaries, active galaxies harbouring a supermassive black hole in their centre, and gigantic clusters of galaxies.\n\nHigh-energy astrophysics is a very active area of modern astronomy, and most of what we know about its objects comes from observational studies. The physical processes, thermal or non-thermal, that produce the observed electromagnetic radiations are explained.\nNon-electromagnetic radiations are also emitted by these high-energetic phenomena, so the course does also touches upon observations of gravitational waves.",
    "Course literature": "Selected material from lecture notes, textbooks and articles available online.",
