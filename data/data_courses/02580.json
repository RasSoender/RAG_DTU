    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of this course is to prepare students for problems that require dealing with geometric data such as point clouds, triangle meshes, or surfaces given implicitly as iso-contours of scalar fields. Such problems include cleaning and merging data from optical scanners, modeling surfaces from scattered points, generating geometry algorithmically, and meshing for FEM simulation. Informed by this larger goal, the immediate objectives are to familiarise students with representations for geometric data and to introduce a range of algorithms for processing geometric data, converting between representations, and visualising geometric data.\n\nThe practical work consists of weekly assignments solved in Python.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nselect and use surface representations for tasks involving geometric data\ncompute differential geometric properties using the Laplace Beltrami operator for triangle meshes\npolygonize implicit surfaces\nrepresent functions on meshes using basis functions and perform interpolation\nsimplify polygonal meshes\nsmooth and remove noise from polygonal meshes\nregister point clouds\ntriangulate 2D point sets using Delaunay triangulation\nparameterize 3D surfaces\nuse the volume representation to process geometric data\nuse computer graphics to visualize geometric data effectively",
    "Content": "The following topics are discussed:\n- Several surface representations, for instance, meshes, distance fields (signed and unsigned), skeletal and medial representations, tetrahedral and hexahedral grids, point clouds, etc.\n- Spectral analys of triangle meshes using methods that are analogous to Fourier analysis.\n- Differential geometry properties of discrete surface representations.\n- Primitive operations on meshes.\n- Simplification and optimization of meshes.\n- Registration of point clouds using the ICP method.\n- Triangulation and manipulation of triangulations.\n- Basis functions and of scattered data.\n- Approaching geometry processing and analysis through programming.\n- Using computer graphics to make geometric data more accessible.",
