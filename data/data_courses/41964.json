    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the assumptions that form the basis for advanced models and analysis.\nCarry out qualitative evaluations as well as detailed analysis of steel structures.\nCarry out analysis and design of more advanced steel structures from practice.\nCarry out analysis and design of member joints with bolted and welded connections.\nCarry out analysis and design of plate girders, including determination of post-critical capacity.\nCarry out analysis and design of steel columns, including built-up columns.\nCarry out analysis and design of thin-walled structures.\nCarry out analysis and design of composite structures concrete/steel.\nDetermine the fatigue life of steel structures.",
    "Content": "Member joints using bolting and welding. Plate girders: Stiffened girders. Plastic moment capacity. Post-critical moment capacity and stiffened panels. Composite girders concrete/steel. Built-up columns. Special, more complicated structural elements and connections: End-plate connections. Beam-to-columm connections. Steel structures subject to fatigue. Fracture mechanics determination of fatigue life.",
