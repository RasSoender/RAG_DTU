    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course will provide future engineers with a basic and broad knowledge of carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies which are emerging and rapidly growing in necessity for large-scale CO2 removal from the atmosphere.\nThe students will:\n1) Acquire an overview of the state-of-the-art as well as new technologies to capture, transport, convert and store CO2.\n2) Develop an understanding of their physical and chemical principles, capabilities and limitations, materials employed, system designs, and techno-economics.\nFurthermore, the students are expected to analyze the comparative advantages and applications of the technologies and to design/select systems for chosen scenarios.\nThe main focus is on the natural science aspects with a smaller part relating to techno-economic aspects.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the basic properties of CO2 and evaluate the environmental impact of CO2 emissions on the environment (greenhouse effect, global warming and consequences), and classify the main the sources of CO2\nUnderstand the goals and effects of political initiatives for CO2 reduction and carbon capture utilization and storage initiatives\nDescribe and differentiate between different systems for CO2 capture, and to describe their role from a system perspective in the complete, up-scaled carbon capture utilization and storage chain\nExplain and compare the basic principles behind most common CO2 storage and transportation technologies\nUnderstand social concerns about carbon capture utilization and storage (e.g. CO2 underground or maritime storage solutions), and judge to which extent they are justified\nExplain state of the art CO2 capture techniques, including their possibilities and limitations, and describe the basic operation principle behind these technologies\nEvaluate emerging CO2 capture technologies, and to critically read and discuss research literature related to such CO2 capture technologies\nState the cost of carbon capture utilization and storage, and estimate and calculate examples of the cost of CO2 capture, storage and utilization\nAnalyze the potential to create value from CO2 ('CO2 to Value' via the conversion to e.g. fuels and chemicals)\nSupport and contribute to meaningful carbon capture utilization and storage initiatives as an ambassador in society, and be able to rebut/disprove misleading 'climate change critical arguments' by applying good scientific practice",
    "Content": "Managing carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels is a major concern for the development of a sustainable energy system in the future. It is a transdisciplinary challenge involving engineering, physical and social science as well as policy and legal issues. Carbon capture, utilization and storage has been widely recognized as an important set of technologies for managing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\nThis course will introduce existing as well as new technologies to capture carbon dioxide from point sources such as power plants or industrial processes (e.g. cement and steel manufacturing), and ultimately the capture of carbon dioxide from ambient air. Furthermore, the course will touch upon CO2 negative concepts (e.g. bio carbon capture storage).\nWith respect to conversion of captured CO2, this course will deal with different conversion technologies, ranging from electrolysis (e.g. solid oxide cells) to algae; the pros and cons of the technologies, required CO2 purity etc., as well as options for storage will be discussed. The course will also include utilization of CO2 in P2X systems, converting CO2 with electricity, additional chemicals and processes into e-fuels and chemicals (e.g. waxes and plastics).\nIn addition to basic science and engineering challenges of the different carbon capture utilization technologies, economic, environmental, regulatory, and political/policy aspects, and their implication for regional and global carbon management strategies of the future will be discussed.\nLastly, a field trip to the ARC CO2 capture facility at Amager Resource Centre will be arranged as part of the course.\nThe course is taught by leading experts with a great deal of experience in this field, and it aims to bridge the gap between the forefront of the latest developments in science, engineering, geology, policy and economics, and the wider public.",
    "Course literature": "In the course we only use teaching material - textbooks, assignments, articles, etc. - that is available via e.g. www, DTU Library, DTU Learn.",
    "Remarks": "The course is largely based on group work. The groups are formed during the first lecture.\nThe latest point to join a group is after the second lecture. Afterwards is will not possible to join this course.",
