    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students an understanding of the basic principles of mathematical modeling and balancing of an electrical system. With a non-electrical perspective, the course introduces the students to the modeling and control of the balance between generation and consumption of a power system with many wind turbines.\nThe students will learn and be technically challenged understanding how wind turbines can influence and contribute to the power balance and frequency control of the power system. To address these challenges, an important part of the course is devoted to theory and practice of modeling and computer simulations. Matlab & Simulink is used as simulation tool to achieve the learning objectives.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand and explain the principles of power system balancing\nIdentify sources of power system imbalance including wind power variability and uncertainty.\nExplain the balancing tool chain.\nDescribe frequency control principles in power systems\nExplain modelling aspects of frequency control\nDescribe basic wind turbine concepts\nExplain and implement simple dynamic models for generators, loads, governors and wind turbines.\nDevelop and implement simple dynamic model for an island power system with wind power\nAnalyze, explain and present model results.\nEvaluate wind turbines contribution to the frequency control in the power system",
    "Content": "Fundamentals for power balance and frequency control; Power balance equation; Generating units components; Load sharing between multiple units; Per unit calculations; Power system frequency control loop with simple models for generators, loads and governors; Wind turbine concepts and characteristics; Aerodynamic power: Power curve and optimal efficiency of a wind turbine; Wind turbine inertia in per-unit; Modeling fixed speed wind turbines; Modelling and control of variable speed wind turbines; Integration of wind power model into the power system model\n\nThe students will work in groups of max. 4 students in the mandatory assignments. The group work will be documented in the form of assignment reports, which must be passed as a condition to participate in the written exam.",
