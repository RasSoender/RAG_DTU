    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAccurate and reliable positioning has become increasingly important for the navigation of vehicles, drones and autonomous systems. Global satellite-based positioning systems play a key role in fulfilling that need.\n\nThe course aims to give a solid knowledge about global navigation satellite systems, how the systems work, and how accurate positions may be obtained. In addition, the course provides a good knowledge of the mathematical modelling principles used for both code and phase-based GNSS positioning (GPS, Galileo, or Glonass) and the integration with other types of navigation sensors.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the role of space-, ground- and user segments of Global Navigation Satellite Systems\nexplain the components of GNSS receivers and the fundamentals of code- and carrier tracking\nanalyze baseband processing algorithms using a GNSS software receiver\nformulate a nonlinear least squares adjustment algorithm for position estimation\nanalyze GNSS error-sources, such as ionospheric delay, tropospheric delay and multipath\napply filtering techniques in GNSS for more reliable estimations\ndescribe other navigation sensors and strategies for integration with GNSS to improve the robustness and solution availability\nreview relative carrier phase position methods for precise positioning applications\napply the RINEX file format to exchange of GNSS measurement and satellite ephemeris parameters",
    "Content": "The basis for the course is to provide the knowledge necessary to develop the methodologies for GNSS data processing for enhanced positioning and navigation.\n\nThe course exercises are based on the implementation of a number of routines and models often used in practice. The lectures support the exercises and provide the necessary mathematical background.\n\nThe following subjects will be dealt with: computation of positions from pseudoranges and carrier phase data, modelling of clock errors and atmospheric effects, computation of DOP-values, transformation of positions and covariances. Furthermore, examples of the use of Kalman filtering for GNSS positioning are discussed, including the challenges related resolution of ambiguities.\n\nExercises are carried out using Matlab.",
