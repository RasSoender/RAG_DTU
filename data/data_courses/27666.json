    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course provides an introduction to machine learning (ML) within the realm of protein engineering, covering fundamental ML models, principles, and their applications in protein design. Participants will gain hands-on experience within cloud computing/HPC (high performance computing), delve into generative models for protein design, and understand the structure and functionality of protein language models. This includes designing and engineering proteins using state-of-the-art ML methods. Through group projects and presentations, students will demonstrate their practical understanding and application of the course material.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSummarise the basics of artificial intelligence (AI) and its application in protein design, including key machine learning (ML) models and principles.\nDescribe and analyse protein structures to be able to integrate this into the protein design and engineering process.\nUse cloud computing/HPC for computational tasks related to protein engineering and machine learning.\nExplore and analyze various models for representation learning and their specific applications in protein design/engineering.\nDesign protein structures using advanced ML tools, understanding their mechanisms and applications.\nImprove and create simple machine learning models for protein science.\nEvaluate the principles of diffusion generative models and apply them to the field of protein design.\nImplement the learned concepts in a practical setting through group projects.\nDisseminate learned knowledge orally in a precise and approachable fashion.\nDiscuss where and how artificial intelligence can be used within protein science.",
    "Content": "Through lectures, exercises, and group work, this intensive 3-week program will cover basic theory, application, and analytical approaches within the realm of machine learning in protein science. The course is structured to provide a balanced mix of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, engaging students in both foundational concepts and advanced applications. It is meant to illustrate the latest advances, current challenges, and real-life applications of ML-guided protein science across a diverse array of real-life applications within biotechnology, biotherapeutics, and beyond.",
    "Remarks": "Please be aware that this course has a minimum requirement for the number of participants needed, in order for it to be held. If these requirements are not met, then the course will not be held. Furthermore, there is a limited number of seats available. If there are too many applicants, a pool will be created for all qualified applicants, and they will be selected at random. You will be informed 8 days before the start of the course, whether you have been allocated a spot.",
