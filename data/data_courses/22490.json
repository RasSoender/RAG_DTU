    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills to develop advanced ultrasound imaging. Over the course, the students will have ample opportunities to program and use a research scanner for ultrasound imaging as part of the lab sessions and design project. The course will cover advanced imaging theory, blood velocity processing, ultrasound simulation, in vitro experimentation, and image quality assessment. The course will be delivered through the following components: 1) Lectures on advanced imaging techniques, 2) Hands-on imaging experiments with an ultrasound research scanner, and 3) Design projects to apply the concepts covered in the lectures.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the principles of ultrasound beamforming and conduct relevant calculations.\nexplain signal processing methods for estimating blood velocity\ncreate new imaging techniques by designing new transmission schemes and processing pipeline\nimplement a new transmission scheme on an ultrasound research scanner\nwrite programs in Matlab that implement advanced image formation and signal processing methods.\nevaluate image resolution and contrast through both simulations and in-vitro experiments.\nevaluate blood flow detection performance and blood velocity estimation accuracy through flow phantoms\nwrite a scientific report explaining the observation made from experiments.",
    "Content": "Ultrasound simulation, Advanced ultrasound imaging technique. Signal processing in flow estimation systems (clutter filtering, mean frequency estimation, and vector flow estimation). Practical use of an ultrasound scanner. Designing validation experiments. Image quality analysis. Report writing",
