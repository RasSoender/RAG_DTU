    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\nThe grade is based on the oral exam and individual assignments/reports. It is also required that group assignments/reports are approved.",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , internal examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "(02402/02403/02323).­02411.­02418 , In addition to an introductory statistics course (e.g. 02402) it is recommended to have at least two relevant statistics courses. The two most relevant courses are 02411 and 02418.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo obtain knowledge about and ability to perform statistical analysis of data using mixed linear models with applications in agriculture, food science, biology, medicine, and technical sciences.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nConstruct and apply factor structure diagrams for complex experimental designs.\nPerform statistical analyses based on the theory of mixed linear models using the statistical software R.\nExplain the theory of mixed linear models.\nDistinguish between random and fixed effects.\nCompare and distinguish between different relevant models and statistical methods.\nPerform, explain, and discuss statistical analyses of data from unbalanced block and split-plot experiments.\nPerform, explain, and discuss statistical analyses of data from unbalanced longitudinal studies.\nPerform, explain, and discuss hierarchical statistical analyses including analyses based on variance component models and regression models with varying coefficients.\nPerform, explain, and discuss statistical analyses for repeated measurements including identification of various correlation structures.\nCombine and modify the various techniques.",
    "Content": "The course will cover basic theory and application of mixed linear models. This includes fixed and random effects but also more general correlation structures relevant to the analysis of repeated measurements/longitudinal data.\n\nIn short: The course gives theoretical and practical tools for performing statistical analysis of data structures which do not satisfy the independence assumptions made in introductory statistics courses.\n\nThe statistical software R will be used.",
