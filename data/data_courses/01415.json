    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis is a course about ingenious methods for solving algebraic questions, such as finding the greatest common divisor of polynomials over a finite field, or finding simultaneous roots to several multivariate polynomials. We are in a discrete and exact arena: integers, fractions, finite fields and polynomials, and our main concern will be to study algorithms that are fast for very large input.\n\nIf you like discrete mathematics, you will like this course because we will dig deep into beautiful and surprising algebraic properties that can be turned into concrete recipes for solving problems. Abstract algebra will become concrete and hands-on by understanding how to actually solve algebraic questions.\n\nWe will take a mathematically stringent approach with proofs of algebraic theorems, algorithms' correctness and their complexity. We will mix this with experimentation with a computer-algebra program.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain how to explicitly represent and compute with very large integers, finite fields, and with polynomials over finite fields.\nDescribe a fast multiplication algorithm and applications for other computations.\nApply modular methods and chinese remaindering to algebraic computations.\nPerform multivariate polynomial division with remainder and describe the role of monomial orders.\nCompute a Gröbner basis and describe its relevance for ideal membership and related problems.\nRepresent real-world problems as non-linear equations and the relation to ideals of multivariate polynomial rings.\nUse a computer algebra system to experimentally work with algebraic problems.\nDetermine the asymptotic complexity of algorithm for algebraic problems in a realistic computational model.\nProve the correctness of algebraic algorithms.",
    "Content": "Exact algebraic computation. Arithmetic in finite fields, with polynomials over finite fields and over integers, and with matrices over finite fields and over integers. Fast algorithms for multiplication. Ideals in Noetherian rings, especially multivariate polynomial rings, Gröbner bases and Buchberger's algorithm.",
