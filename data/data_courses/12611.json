    "Previous Course": "11122",
    "Not applicable together with": "11122",
    "Academic prerequisites": "12601/11121 , The course will focus on mass transfer, while only shortly revisiting heat transfer since prior knowledge of heat transfer in building components is assumed. Students without this prior knowledge may participate, but will need to work extra on their own on heat transfer.",

    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRÃ˜N DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course will give you insight and skills to analyse heat, air and moisture transfer in building components and building zones. These will allow you to make hygrothermal designs for new building components and building zones, and to diagnose hygrothermal problems in existing building components and building zones.\nMoreover, the course will give you proficiency in the required mathematical techniques and problem solving approaches.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nclarify why heat, air and moisture transfer are essential in the hygrothermal design and diagnosis of building components and building zones\nformulate heat, air and moisture balances for the analysis of hygrothermal problems\nexplain and apply the transport equations for heat, air and moisture in building components and building zones\napply mathematical methods and problem solving approaches for hygrothermal calculations\nassess the reliability of the obtained results\nclassify building materials concerning their hygrothermal properties\nevaluate the influences of material properties on the generic hygrothermal response of building components and building zones\ndesign hygrothermally correct building components and building zones\ndiagnose hygrothermally incorrect building components and building zones",
    "Content": "The course will teach you to design hygrothermally correct and to diagnose hygrothermally incorrect building components and whole buildings. To those aims, the following issues will be discussed:\n- criteria for building component durability and proper hygrothermal condition of building zones;\n- heat, air and moisture balances;\n- heat transfer revisited (conduction, convection, radiation, advection);\n- moisture transfer (vapour diffusion, advection of vapour, liquid capillary transfer);\n- air transfer (air diffusion);\n- building materials and their hygrothermal properties (structural materials, insulation, air barriers and vapour barriers);\n- mathematical methods (systems of equations, non-linearity, control-volume method);\n- problem solving approaches (conceptualization, reliability)\n- importance of heat, air and moisture transfer when designing buildings for energy efficiency and sustainability",
