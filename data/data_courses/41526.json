    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUse stress-functions to solve plane elastic problems.\nDetermine stress intensity factors for cracks.\nUse linear elastic fracture mechanics (both stress and energy criteria) to predict crack initiation and growth in brittle materials.\nEstimate the size of plastic zones at crack tips.\nEstablish the applicability of linear elastic fracture mechanics for a given problem.\nCalculate the J-integral and crack opening displacement in elastic-plastic materials and use these to determine critical loads with respect to crack growth.\nDetermine the direction of crack propagation.\nDetermine critical load under fully plastic conditions\nAnalyze crack growth under cyclic loading.",
    "Content": "Stress functions (Airy's and Westergaard's), stress concentrations, stress singularities at crack tips, linear-elastic fracture mechanics, energy methods, plasticity at crack tips, the J-integral, the HRR-field, cohesive zone modeling, criteria for the direction of crack extension, fatigue during cyclic loading, Paris law.",
