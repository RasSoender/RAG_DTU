    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will provide the participants with a basal understanding of aquatic ecology, organism biology and biodiversity, including concepts of ecosystem function and services. All topics covered, will be placed in context of fisheries, aquaculture or biodiversity conservation and restoration.\nAfter having completed this course, participants with no prior education or other backgrounds from within the field of ecology and organism biology, should be sufficiently equipped to face the remainder of the study program of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture. Students with a bachelor in aquatic ecology, wildlife biology or similar, should contact the head of education (on Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture) to see if this course should be optional rather than compulsory to the education in Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nOutlining differences between the major ecosystem groupings based on biotic and abiotic characteristics (incl. habitat descriptions).\nIdentifying key trophic linkages in different ecosystems.\nSummarizing major life histories and traits.\nDefine genetic plasticity in the context of local adaptations\nSketching food web structures and intra-specific dependencies.\nMatching habitats with fauna and fish communities.\nExplaining the meaning of “biodiversity” in different contexts.\nDeducing ecosystem services from ecosystem descriptions.\nInferring simple ecological relationships from observations.",
    "Content": "Most of earth is covered in water and below the surface a diversity of habitats and organisms can be encountered. In combination with the physical and chemical environment, these makes up distinct and interconnected ecosystems with unique characteristics. A fundamental understanding of the functioning of these ecosystems is vital when we attempt to innovate sustainable solutions of the future that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem services. The course constitute a series of lectures with associated group assignments in the classroom, lab and in the field. The group assignment is spread out during the course period requires a total of four deliveries in the form of reports or similar. Lectures will introduce (1) the abiotic and biotic components and functions of ecosystems in freshwater, estuarine and marine environments, (2) life history adaptions (incl. the basal genetic mechanisms) and trait biology, (3) habitat types and functions, and (4) community networks and intra-specific dependencies (incl. food webs and animal trophic cascades).",
    "Course literature": "Fundamentals of Aquatic Ecology, R.S.K. Barnes and K.H. Mann, Wiley Online Library (eISBN 9781444314113)\nA selection of scientific articles that will be handed out during the course",
    "Remarks": "This course provides students with competences relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #13 (Climate action) and #14 (Life below water)",
