    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course offers concepts and tools in economics and finance to support managerial decision-making. It emphasizes theory and practice with real life examples to sharpen analytical skills, teach how to think strategically, and provide intuition on interpreting analytical results. Hence, students will experience solving decision-making problems using the tools covered in the course. Strategic thinking will be introduced via game theoretical models and real-world examples. The importance of theory in the decision-making process, the key issues in pricing in different market structures, and product differentiation choices will be introduced. The effects of strategic decisions and government regulation on firm performance and social welfare will be discussed.\nTo give students an understanding of…\n• How demand and supply forces work under different market structures\n• How investment decisions can be made\n• How oligopolistic markets differ from perfectly competitive markets and monopoly\n• How to think strategically when there is mutual interdependence between market players\n• How pricing, output, and location strategies effect firm performance and welfare in different markets",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply comparative statics to understand how market equilibrium changes\nUnderstand and use capital budgeting techniques\nUse elasticity estimates for managerial decisions\nEstimate and interpret the market risk of a financial asset\nUnderstand and quantify key determinants of market structure, performance, and conduct.\nThink strategically regarding location, quantity, and price choices\nFind optimal pricing and output levels in different markets using game theory\nEvaluate the link between competition, regulation, and welfare.\nDevelop strategies for product pricing.",
    "Content": "I. Course introduction\nII. Corporate finance\na. Intro, basic concepts, and definitions\nb. Valuation\nc. Fundamentals of capital budgeting\nd. Risk and return\nIII. Structure, conduct, performance\na. Basic Market Structure (Demand and Supply, elasticities, and consumer and producer\nsurpluses)\nb. How to measure market structure: concentration measures, product heterogeneity,\nentry/exit barriers, information\nc. Understanding firm conduct: pricing-output decisions with market power (more detail\nin game theory), R&D, advertising, collusion (cartels: OPEC)\nd. How to measure firm and market performance: profit, different performance\nmeasures, efficiency, welfare\nIV. Step into other players’ shoes (strategic interactions)\na. Simultaneous move (Normal form) games: Dominant strategy, iterated elimination of\ndominated strategies, Nash equilibrium (brief intro to best response functions)\nExamples: prisoner’s dilemma (PD), pollution abatement, coordination, technology\nadoption, game of chicken, strict competition.\nb. Sequential move (Extensive form) games: Backward induction, subgame perfect\nequilibrium, strategies to deal with empty threats and promises (Examples: Chain-\nstore, centipede, bargaining)\nc. Repeated games (finite and infinite): discounting, tit-for-tat, and grim trigger\nstrategies (Examples: repeated PD, can collaboration be saved?)\nd. Equilibrium in mixed strategies: randomization to prevent exploitation or as a means\nof coordination (Examples: matching pennies, Battle of the Sexes, PD)\ne. Evolutionary games: evolutionarily stable strategies, replicator dynamics (Examples:\nHawk-Dove\nVI. Markets and pricing strategies\na. Perfect Competition: a benchmark market structure\nb. Monopoly: highest market power, natural gas, oil, and electricity as natural\nmonopolies\nc. Monopolistic Competition: product differentiation creates monopoly power\nd. Price Discrimination\ni. 1st degree (perfect) discrimination\nii. 2nd degree (quantity) discrimination: à la carte vs buffet\niii. 3rd degree (group) discrimination: student/senior discounts\nV. Oligopolistic games (Ramazan Sari) 2 weeks\na. Cournot: duopoly, N-player, symmetric, asymmetric, welfare (Example: Airbus vs\nBoeing)\nb. Bertrand: pricing in homogeneous/heterogeneous product markets, welfare (Example:\nPizza Hut & Dominos)\nc. Stackelberg: symmetric/asymmetric costs, welfare (Example: Coke vs Pepsi)\nd. Spatial and attribute space location choice: Hotelling’s linear city, Salop’s circle\n(Examples: gas stations, ice cream flavors)",
