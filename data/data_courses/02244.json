    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the basic concepts introduced in the course and explain the role of logic for security in concrete settings;\napply advanced tools for modeling and analyzing protocols;\ndesign and motivate a series of experiments for analysing security properties;\nanalyze and interpret the results obtained from advanced analysis tools;\ndescribe the ideas of methods for automated security tools and apply them to small examples;\nidentify strengths and weaknesses of different methods;\ngiven a formal description of a policy, explain its meaning and determine if a given program satisfies the policy;\nformally specify the privacy and accountability goals of a distributed system\nanalyze the use of advanced cryptographic primitives (like zero knowledge) in a system\ndetermine the applicability of compositional reasoning for security;\ncommunicate the results in a clear and precise manner, using a standard format for technical reports.",
    "Content": "The course covers security protocols, their modeling and analysis, including techniques and tools that can be used to either detect confidentiality and authentication errors or to guarantee that no such errors can occur.
