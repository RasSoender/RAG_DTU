    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\n• Gained core competences: Develop your own impact pathway from source to damage on human health, ecosystem quality and natural resources for a topic of your choice\n• Gained knowledge: Methods and data to assess and evaluate health and environmental impacts from local to global scale, thorough understanding of assessment principles, mathematical modeling steps, and working with available or missing data\n• Gained skills: Identify, apply and interpret results of assessment methods and tools for quantifying environmental, health and life cycle impacts associated with emissions and resources consumption, incl. limitations, assumptions and uncertainty\n• Presumed knowledge: Fundamentals in mathematical modeling and environmental chemistry; knowledge in life cycle (impact) assessment and/or risk assessment and/or policy analysis is helpful\n• Required expertise in follow-up education (as engineers): Identify and apply approaches for evaluating environmental problems in different decision contexts",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe and analyze complex real-life impact assessment and chemical substitution problems\nExplain principles and modeling approaches of different impact assessment methods\nApply impact assessment methods to questions from life cycle assessment, alternatives assessment, product design and sustainability assessment\nApply models to quantify environmental and health impacts, e.g. of chemical or plastic emissions\nCharacterize impacts based on existing data and assessment models\nEvaluate strengths and limitations of quantitative impact assessment methods and determine and justify uncertainties\nIdentify and answer research questions from different environmental management fields\nDesign and develop impact pathways that are aligned with current impact quantification methods\nCommunicate model results consistently and structured in oral and written form",
    "Content": "The course consists of 3 main sections: (i) overview, understanding and modeling steps of different impact assessment methods; (ii) principles, analysis and development of impact pathways and quantification of environmental fate, exposure and effects of different stressors; (e) rank and recommend best-in-class solutions based on quantified impacts and communicating results in a consistent, reliable and transparent way to decision makers and stakeholders",
