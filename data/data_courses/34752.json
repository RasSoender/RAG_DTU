    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course is designed to investigate cutting-edge problems in brain-inspired intelligent robotics. It presents principles from different fields: robotics, AI, biology, and computational neuroscience.\n\nThe aim is to facilitate the:\n1. Understanding of concepts, methods, and tools used in the field of Neuro-robotics,\n2. Analysis of simple brain-based models for control of robotic systems, and\n3. Use of traditional and bio-inspired tools to control the dynamic behavior of robotic systems.\n\nBy the end of the course, the students will be able to propose a research problem, to describe it, and promote their ideas and solutions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nRelate the organization and function of the motor hierarchy\nUse a mathematical model and analyze the information processing by neurons\nExplain the role of the cerebellum to voluntary movements\nUtilize knowledge from cerebellar control theory in the assessment of robotics tasks\nDesign and build simple neural networks\nDetermine the bio-inspired control loop to be implemented for a specific case-study\nDesign and implement basic bio-inspired control loops for robots\nDescribe a research problem, promote ideas and technological solutions",
    "Content": "This course regards three main core areas and its intersection:\n1. Neural science\nBrain areas and their functions\nMotor hierarchy for voluntary movements\nPrinciples of neural networks\nMotor control\n2. Neural processing\nElectrical signal transmission in neurons and between neurons\nNeuronal biological and artificial models\nNeural Network computing\n3. Control\nBio-inspired control principles\nBiomimetic control blocks for robots\nCerebellar control models\nBio-inspired robotic applications",
    "Remarks": "The course is a relevant technological specialisation course.\nE-learning is used in the form of e.g., on-line quiz (in-class assignments), online discussions or blog, and digital exam.\n\nIf overbooked priority is given to Electro Masters students, and among these first priority is given to those who have passed 34721/34722.",
