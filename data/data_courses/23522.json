    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the students to understand the theoretical background for structure and rheology of liquid and solid materials. Furthermore the students shall be able to apply a wide range og experimental techniques to determine physical attributes of foods and biomaterials.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\napply relevant theory to explain the rheological, textural and structural properties of liquids, semi-solids and solids\napply rheological models and utilize associated theory\nuse common rheological measuring techniques and understand the applicability of these\nplan and conduct relevant rheological experiments to uncover rheological and structural attributes\nanalyse and qualify experimental data from relevant rheological measuring methods\nanalyse similarities and differences in products using rheological data and theory\napply linear viscoelastic models and understand their limitations\napply low deformation (oscillation, flow, creep) and large deformation (texture analysis, compression) experimental methods\napply the time-temperature superposition principle to analyze experimental data for viscoelastic systems, food products and biological materials",
    "Content": "Theory: flow properties of non-newtonian liquids, elasticity of liquids, semi-solid and solid materials, physical foundation and rheological matematical models.\nMeasuring techniques: rotational rheometers,capillary rheometers, texture analyser, mikroskopi, extrusion rheology, measurement of particle size and related simpler methods.\nPlanning and condution of experiments to explain differences and similarities between a range of comparable products.\nIntrepretation of data and presentation of condensed conclusions.",
    "Remarks": "The course is primarily for MSc students, but students at the 5th semester of the Food Science bachelor education may also participate. MSc students attending one of DTU's food programmes have priority. The course is approved as a technological specialisation course in the MSc Advanced and Applied Chemistry (kandidatretning Anvendt Kemi).",
