    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe laws of nature at the quantum scale are different than the laws of classical physics\nexperienced in everyday life. This difference can be exploited to improve information processing tasks and to enable new ones which are otherwise impossible. One striking example is the possibility for quantum computers which can solve certain tasks exponentially faster than any traditional computer. The aim of this course is to introduce you to the theory of quantum information, to give you an understanding of different quantum information protocols including quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and quantum computing, and to give you a little hands-on experience with state-of-the-art quantum technology locally and/or through cloud services.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nRecognise the notions of quantum superposition and entanglement in the context of quantum information.\nQuestion the nonlocal nature of reality; perform and interpret an experiment testing nonlocality.\nDiscuss the concept of quantum communication including quantum teleportation and quantum repeaters.\nCompare different protocols for quantum key distribution and random number generation.\nExplain the main concepts of quantum computing, including gates, circuits, and error correction.\nDiscuss various quantum algorithms, their implementation, and advantages over classical algorithms.\nDescribe different quantum technologies for quantum information processing.\nAnalyse, discuss and critique articles on quantum information experiments.\nProgram a simple quantum computer program using one of the available development toolkits.",
    "Content": "The concept of quantum information will be introduced and discussed. Starting from the basic principles of quantum mechanics (superpositions, unitary transformations, and measurements), qubit states, entangled states, and mixed states will be rigorously discussed. Quantum information protocols such as quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation will be introduced. Bell's inequality will be discussed and (if time allows) tested in the lab.\nAnother subject is quantum computing which includes the discussion of different single and two qubit gates as well as various algorithms including Shorâ€™s factoring algorithm. The different physical technologies for the implementation of quantum information processing will be discussed. Finally, there will be hands-on computational exercises on programming a quantum computer, either by simulation or over the cloud.\nTwo to three topics (e.g. loophole-free Bell tests, Grover's algorithm) will be studied in-depth through group work. The presentations of this will contribute to the student's overall grade.",
