    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course offers a comprehensive understanding of ocean observation technology, providing students with the essential knowledge and skills necessary to conduct successful ocean field work. The course covers a broad range of topics, including practical physical, biological, chemical, and geological oceanography, data management, logistics, and communication.\nStudents will engage in hands-on experiences, learning how to plan, execute, and analyze ocean field work effectively. The course will also equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to operate a wide range of observation technologies and professional oceanographic instruments.\n\nStructured according to the CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate) principles, the course will teach students how to design and operate ocean observation systems, implement effective data management strategies, and communicate results clearly and effectively. By the end of this course, students will have acquired practical skills and knowledge that are critical for conducting successful ocean field work, making them well-equipped to tackle challenges in ocean observation technology.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe different instruments used for data collection at sea.\nExplain advantages and disadvantages of the different instruments in operational settings.\nFormulate and design a data collection experiment at sea.\nPrepare an experimental protocol to ensure data quality.\nDesign an experimental plan to ensure coordination, logistics and safety for personnel and equipment.\nPerform data collection at sea on board of RV HAVFISKEN.\nLead the experiment at sea and keep an experimental log.\nExecute post processing of acquired data.\nPrepare an experiment report with a comprehensive summary of the results",
    "Content": "The objective of this course is to provide the student with an overview of aquatic field work that will enable the student to perform top down design of a scientific experiment in the aquatic environment under constraints such as organization, instrument availability, time and cost. The student will work in a group, plan and execute an actual experiment, perform post processing of acquired data and prepare a report documenting the process.",
    "Remarks": "This course provides students with competences relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #14 (Life below water)",
