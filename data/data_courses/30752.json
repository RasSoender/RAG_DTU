    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe cryosphere is the part of the Earth's surface covered by snow or ice. The cryosphere is sensitive to changes in the climate, and in recent years an increased mass loss of the large ice sheets and a decrease in the sea ice cover have been observed.\n\nThis course aims to teach students about the physics of ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice and the geodetic methods for monitoring the cryosphere from satellites and aeroplanes.\n\nThe focus will be on the use of different data sets relevant to monitoring the cryosphere and on the geophysical interpretation of the data and its connection to the global climate system.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the basic physics of ice\nidentify the most important feedback mechanisms between the cryosphere and the climate system\nperform a geophysical or climatic interpretation of a relevant data set\nselect a relevant data set (amongst e.g., gravimetry, altimetry, GNSS) for monitoring of a given cryosphere phenomenon\nrun simple glacier and sea ice models and analyse the model output\nanalyse gravimetry data from the GRACE satellites and use these to estimate the mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet\ndebate how geodynamics can influence different types of measurements\ncharacterize the individual contributions to the mass balance of ice sheets and sea ice, and outline how these can be estimated from data and models\nevaluate model results of e.g. post-glacial rebound and estimate the uncertainty of such models\npresent a scientific topic.",
    "Content": "Geodetic methods for monitoring the ice sheets and sea ice from satellites and aeroplanes. Physics of ice sheets and sea ice (ice motion and properties of snow and ice).
