    "Schedule": "June",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "This 3-week lab course teaches designing and prototyping advanced wearable sensors, including resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric, electrochemical, and temperature types. Through hands-on projects leading to a multifunctional prototype demo, the course blends theory with practical fabrication, analysis, and integration skills, preparing students for healthcare tech innovation.",
    "Duration of Course": "3 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "The last day",
    "Type of assessment": "Evaluation of experiments and reports\nThe final evaluation comprises two components: - Individual assignments during the course - Group project with individualization Each part exam will get a part grade, which counts 50% in the final assessment. Individual assignments: Students are required to complete individual assignments throughout the course. These assignments contribute to the overall assessment of the course. Group project evaluation: For assessment, each group must submit their completed project and conduct a presentation. At least 80% of the group members must actively participate in the presentation. Peer evaluation forms will be distributed after each presentation to assess individual contributions.",
