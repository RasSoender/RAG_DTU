    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nChemical process design is about finding a sustainable process that can convert the raw materials to the desired products in a cost-effective manner. Chemical engineers support diverse sectors and process industries, from chemicals and fuels to polymers, textiles, food, and pharmaceuticals. Given this diverse set of industries and sectors with their own domain-specific equipment and standards, in this course, the objective is to introduce students to systematic methods for process design, to give an overview of the main steps involved in the typical life cycle of a process design, as well as the complexity of the design activity. In addition to a systematic approach to process design, we stress the importance of iterative process analysis, including economics, uncertainty & sensitivity analysis, heat integration, optimization, and sustainability analysis. In this way, the course aims to train the students with flexible skills and competencies for conceptual process design needs across diverse process industries.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply a systematic approach to process design\nIdentify, gather, and analyze necessary data, methods, and models for the design\nAppreciate the complexity of process design & make design-related decisions\nGenerate and evaluate/screen alternatives for design\nUse computer-aided tools & work in groups.\nUse computer-aided tools & work in groups.\nVerify and analyze simulation results.\nPerform heat integration and design via pinch analysis.\nApply nonlinear programming for process optimization\nPerform life cycle analysis (LCA) to assess environmental aspects of sustainable process design\nUse chemical and biochemical engineering knowledge to solve practical engineering problems.",
    "Content": "The course consists of classroom lectures followed by group work on the project assignment.\n\nThe course lectures follow the task-based systematic design methodology, which introduces systematic methods and concepts for process design as follows:\nLecture 1: Introduction to process design\nLecture 2: Process flowsheet synthesis & verification (Douglas method)\nLecture 3: Flowsheet performance evaluation – a simple strategy\nLecture 4: Reactor Design, analysis & sizing -rigorous models\nLecture 5: Separation process design & sizing -rigorous models\nLecture 6: Sensitivity Analysis in Process Design\nLecture 7: Capital and Production Cost Estimation\nLecture 8: Economic Assessment and Uncertainty Analysis\nLecture 9: Process and Flowsheet Optimization\nLecture 10: Heat Integration and HXN design\nLecture 11: Sustainability Analysis in Process Design\n\nThe project assignment which is worked in groups of e.g. 3 members contains three parts that builds on each other:\nPart 1. Scope of Design\nImplement the conceptual process in a simulator of your choice (Aveva or excel spreadsheet). Report and discuss mass and energy calculations (Lectures 1 to 5).\nPart 2. Process economics and uncertainty analysis.\nPerform cost estimation, economics, sensitivity & uncertainty analysis, and discuss the results (Lectures 6 to 8)\nPart 3. Advanced process analysis (e.g. process optimization, heat integration, and sustainability analysis)\nPerform optimization, heat integration, and sustainability analysis, compare/benchmark other alternatives, and discuss the results. (Lectures 9 – 11).\nEach part will be followed by selected group presentations (each group will present at least one part of the assignment).",
