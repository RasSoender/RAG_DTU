    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main objective is for the students to be able to carry out a structural design of a multi-storey building consisting of mainly precast concrete elements.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the structural system of a multi-storey precast concrete building\nExplain how requirements and non-structural elements influence the structural system\nDetermine and calculate the relevant load actions on a building\nDescribe the load path through a building\nAnalyze a precast concrete building subjected to vertical loads and design a load carrying system\nAnalyze the stability of a precast concrete building subjected to horizontal loads and design a bracing system\nEvaluate individual elements in service state and ultimate limit state\nApply relevant joints in connections between precast concrete elements",
    "Content": "The course mainly consists of lectures and project work in groups with sub-assignments. In the project group, the students design a multi-storey precast concrete building based on the topics from the lectures and most often in accordance with the European standards. Some of the methods learned are also applicable for buildings of other materials.\nThe students are graded based on the assessment of one or two reports about topics from the project work. The students will get formative feedback during the course, e.g. via peer assessment.\nSome of the topics are: Load combinations, design of horizontal and vertical members, stabilizing walls, the rigid floor method, structural joints etc.",
