    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRÃ˜N DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective is to gather insight and experience in applying the method Biologically Inspired Design (BID) - which also includes the topics biomimetics, biomimicry and bionics. BID is used to search nature for relevant analogical solutions and apply the findings actively as inspiration when developing and designing products.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nformulate a user need as a functional requirement\nsearch for biological solutions including formulating the functional requirements in biological terms\napply biological search engines like asknature.org and eol.org\nsearch biological literature (books and scientific papers) e.g. at the library at DTU and Copenhagen University\nhave knowledge of biological knowledge sources and the biological taxonomy\nformulate biological phenomena as technical solutions principles by applying biocards\ncreate a solution space on a conceptual level from the biological inspiration\nuse knowledge of biological phenomena for the design of technical solutions\nvalidate biological inspired technical solutions empirically\ndescribe challenges in designing with inspiration in nature\ncommunicate working method and results in scientific and popular form",
    "Content": "The course basically aims at giving the participants knowledge of how biology can be used activily in technical development. A basic understanding of Biologically Inspired Deisgn as a development method is established including possibilities and challenges in designing with inspiration in nature. The course include an introduction to BID and a 3 phase project:\n\n1. Search: Search in biological literature and a literature study for a selected functional area,\n2. Interpretation: Identification of relevant biological analogies and principles and translation into technical solution principles\n3. Design: Sketching, development and validation of new solutions\n\nExamples of functional areas could be:\n- food storage (need for new conservation techniques), e.g. the spiders sedation of prey, mice food stock,...\n- silent aerodynamics (need for silent windmills, ventilators,...), e.g. the silent flight of owls...\n- night vision (need for orientation in the dark), e.g. insect vision, kats vision, owls hearing, sharks stereo smell sensation, bat sonar,...\n- navigation (need for geographic orientation) e.g. manure beetles and polarisation, migrating birds and butterflies,...\n- cleaning (need for not getting dirty), e.g. hydrophobic surfaces at lotus plants, dirt and water repellant bird feathers, ...",
    "Remarks": "A collaboration has been established with the course LFKK10412U Innovation - Inspired by Nature at Copenhagen University (KU). KU students can participate in the DTU course and contribute with their biological/science background in the project groups. There will also be supervision from biologists from Copenhagen University.",
