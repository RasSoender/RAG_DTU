    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe general goal of the course is to introduce theory, analysis, and synthesis of discrete-time signals and systems, which are used in modern acoustics and hearing science. The students will make quantitative estimations and detailed written calculations. Technical applications in the field of acoustics will be examined in exercises and Matlab simulations. Formative feedback will be given on submitted assignments.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the principles of sampling of continuous-time signals.\nuse a Fourier transform to analyze signals in the frequency domain in one and two dimensions.\nanalyze, modify and synthesize signals using the short-time discrete Fourier transform and other filter banks.\napply linear system theory to simulate processing of signals through acoustic systems.\nanalyze and characterize stochastic signals and systems through power-spectral density, coherence and auto- and cross spectral analysis.\ndesign and perform impulse response measurements to characterize an acoustic system.\ndesign and perform transfer function measurements to characterize an acoustic system.\nimplement signal processing algorithms and visualize results using Matlab.",
    "Content": "As an acoustical engineer you often need to apply signal processing techniques to obtain the desired function in a technological solution. This course provides the fundamental knowledge in digital signal processing techniques relevant in (but not limited to) modern acoustical engineering and hearing science. The following topics will be covered:\n• Sampling in time and space\n• Fourier analysis\n• Windowing and zero-padding\n• Linear system analysis\n• Filters and filter banks\n• Auto- and cross-correlation and coherence\n• Noise and statistical moments\n\nIn addition to lectures, the course contains three practical modules with a focus on: 1) impulse response measurements, 2) binaural dereverberation and 3) transfer function measurements.",
