    "Content": "In collaboration with a company a business case is developed. Focus is on the students own ideas, but they will work with inside-out/outside-in innovation, which means that the final idea which is pursued in the course may come from the company or from the students. The focus will be on applying a innovation process model, business model canvas and iterative customer based development of the business case.\nThe course consists of lectures, reading material, group exercises and assignments and peer-reviews. A large part of the learning activities are group based and it thus crucial to participate in class.",
