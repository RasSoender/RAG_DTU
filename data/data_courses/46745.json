    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course provides the students with an overview to relevant control issues of power systems and gives knowledge about operational integration of wind power.\nAnalysis of the different electrical wind turbines technologies and their interaction with the grid both during transients and steady states.\nModelling of wind turbines, load flows and influence on system frequency and voltages are investigated with the usage of the simulation software DIgSILENT - Powerfactory.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze power system operation principles\nExplain the role of voltage and frequency control in power systems\nPerform load flow calculations in meshed grids\nExplain the main types of wind turbines\nDescribe advanced stationary and dynamic models of wind turbines\nCreate wind power and power systems models in Powerfactory\nVerify grid code compliance\nAssess how wind turbines can support power system secure operation\nAbility to define your own research questions\nAbility to work in groups and effective oral communication",
    "Content": "Power system operation principles. Wind power and wind generator types.\nModeling of wind turbines and large wind farms.\nImpact of wind on power systems stability, particularly on frequency and voltage.\nFrequency and voltage control and compliance with grid codes.\nStatic and dynamic simulation studies with Powerfactory.",

    "Remarks": "E-learning is used in the form of on-line quiz (home assignments), interactive quiz and electronic correction system.\nYouTube videos on Mattia's channel support the learning process.\nBasic knowledge of Powerfactory is highly recommended - students with no knowledge of the software are strongly advised to take the tutorial before the course begins.\nPre-course tutorial can be taken by using the PCs in the databars in B325 and B329 (just launch powerfactory, open the help menu and start tutorial).\nThe course organisation requires an early stage assignment in the first 4 weeks. Non-participation will be considered as drop-out from the course.",
