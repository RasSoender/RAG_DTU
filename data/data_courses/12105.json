    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course provides the understanding and quantitative tools needed by engineers and scientists to create engineering solutions for a sustainable society within their own educational disciplines. The students learn about terms, definition, and units related to sustainability, the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability and the importance of geographical and temporal scale when considering engineering solutions. Focus will be placed on understanding sustainability and developing sustainable solutions from an industrial perspective.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe and critically reflect on the environmental, social, and economic considerations and challenges to creating ‘sustainable engineering solutions’ in practice across multiple geographical and temporal scales\nCritically evaluate sustainability in current practice across the three Sustainability Pillars; environment, society and economy\nAnalyze and quantify, from a life cycle perspective, the sustainability of a chosen product or service within their educational discipline through a group assignment using the sustainability tools introduced during the course\nApply current state-of-the-art tools to quantify sustainability whilst considering the complex interlinkage of sustainability challenges currently faced within climate change and the sources impacting climate change, effects on human health and the environment, effects on biodiversity of ecosystems, and the scarcity of certain resources\nExplain the uncertainties associated with sustainability assessments\nExplain the importance of a systemic perspective when assessing the sustainability of all technology and practices considering the current and future technological, environmental, social, and economic landscape\nDescribe main components of an absolute environmental sustainability assessment\nCritically engage with the principles of life cycle assessment (LCA) in practice by evaluating the outputs of several life cycle assessments\nDescribe the principle of Circular Economy and how that affects societal flows of resources",
    "Content": "• Terms, definitions and units describing sustainability, impact challenges to sustainable engineering solutions (Emission and climate change, Impacts on human, environment, scarcity of resources), social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, absolute environmental sustainability assessment, circular economy (definitions, reasons, and drivers), principle of life cycle assessments, quantitative tools for evaluating sustainability",
