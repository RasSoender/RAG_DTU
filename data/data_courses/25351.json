    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe following course objectives are to:\n• Identify the current European and Danish environmental legislation for aquaculture effluent treatment “End-of-Pipe strategies” and how the different end-of-pipe technologies can be applied in a given scenario.\n• Explain the knowledge of current and emerging technologies in end-of-pipe treatment for aquaculture with a focus on nitrogen (N), organic matter (OM), and phosphorus (P), such as denitrification, coagulation, flocculation, organic matter filtration, phosphorus recovery, aquaponics, and land-based seaweed cultivation.\n• Deliver an overview of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter masses availability and forms discharged from a RAS, their eutrophication potential, and their role as residual resource.\n• Provide insight into the most important methods for designing end-of-pipe technology for a given discharge quota (N, P, and OM).\n• Present and apply the use of model optimization tools for end-of-pipe treatment through benchmark experiments and model fitting techniques.\n\nTheoretical knowledge (through lectures) and practical experience will be achieved through exercises, laboratory experiments and a final basic engineering project report. A field trip to fish farms with different end-of-pipe treatment technologies will couple the theoretical learning with the real applications giving insight for the final project report.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nList the different nomenclature and water quality analysis applied in RAS end-of-pipe treatment\nOutline the importance of residual resource valorization and its role in European and International strategies for sustainable development.\nDescribe main types and forms of waste discharged, calculate the masses produced and potential available resources.\nUnderstand the principles of design of end-of-pipe technology for treating nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter for achieving discharged quotas\nExplain the principles of the physical-chemical-biological processes and technologies for the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter.\nReport process kinetics and mass balances and define a simple volume control for efficiency technology evaluation.\nEvaluate which parameters influence the capacity of the proposed technologies for process optimization.\nCombine and utilize the knowledge achieved during the course, for creating and formulating a solution for an end-of-pipe treatment application under a specific case scenario. This will be done by preparing a “Basic engineering proposal”.",
    "Content": "Untreated aquaculture effluent can contain excess nutrients, organic matter, and other pollutants that can negatively affect water quality and harm aquatic ecosystems. Nutrient-rich effluent can lead to eutrophication causing algae blooms, oxygen depletion, and habitat degradation, harming fish and other aquatic life. Many countries have regulations and standards in place to control the discharge of pollutants from aquaculture operations. The European Union (EU) has established regulations and directives governing various aspects of aquaculture, including the management of aquaculture effluents to protect water quality and ecosystems as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) aiming at achieving good water status for all surface waters (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) and groundwater within the EU. Aquaculture activities are required to comply with local and national measures to minimize their impact on water quality, such as Strategic Guidelines for the Sustainable Development of European Aquaculture, Blue Growth Strategy, Strategic Action Plan for European Aquaculture, Farm to Fork Strategy and the European Green deal.\n\"End-of-pipe treatment\" in aquaculture refers to the practice of treating waste or effluent generated by fish farms or aquaculture facilities before it is released into natural water bodies such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. It helps aquaculture facilities in complying with environmental regulations and avoiding fines or legal penalties. Treatment of effluent is a key component of sustainable aquaculture practices, minimizing environmental footprint and reducing negative impacts on surrounding ecosystems. The concept of the circular economy in aquaculture effluent management involves minimizing waste, maximizing resource efficiency, and promoting the reuse and recycling of by-products and nutrients within the aquaculture production as; residual resource valorization, nutrient recovery, energy production, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems, aquaponics, and land-based seaweed.\nEngineering solutions for aquaculture end-of-pipe treatment are crucial in the sustainable development and efficient operation of aquaculture systems. These solutions require knowledge on; system design and planning, system evaluation and mass balances, water quality management and processes, environmental impact assessment and mitigation, optimization of system performance and holistic concepts for minimizing environmental impacts while reducing operational costs and increasing profitability.",
    "Remarks": "The course includes the following modules:\n•Overview and perspectives in aquaculture environmental sustainability strategies and legislation.\n•Overview of traditional and emerging technologies for Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Organic Matter removal\n•Nitrogen removal technologies and processes\n•Phosphorus and organic matter removal technologies and processes\n•Nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter recovery technologies and biomass valorization\n•Design concepts, process parameters and optimization, kinetics, masses, and evaluation treatment efficiency\n•Selection of components and operational cost estimation\n•Concept and application of residual resources for a circular economy approach\n•Process optimization through the use of statistical models\n•Basic engineering documentation, scopes, and implementation.",
