    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course builds on the basic understanding of design of wood-based element and connections, by introducing orthotropic mechanical properties of wood and how these properties influence the design of elements with varying cross-sections and curved shapes. The course covers advanced topics such as finite element modelling, built-up elements, fire design, moisture deformations, and moment- and screwed connections.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze the performance of advanced wooden structures by taking into account its specific behavior in terms of anisotropy, strength, rigidity, humidity, load duration, and fire properties.\nAnalyze and calculate timber structural elements with varying cross-sections and curved shapes.\nAnalyze, and devise relevant measures, for the bracing of large timber frame structures.\nDefine and evaluate the impact of serviceability criteria on the performance of large timber buildings and building components.\nDefine and handle time and moisture dependent effects and loads on timber structures.\nAnalyze complex structures in both solid timber, glulam and Engineered Wood Products (EWP) using Finite Element software.\nAssess and calculate mechanical connections that are able to resist large forces and moments.\nUse relevant standards and literature in the design of advanced wood structures.\nTake part of a design team working with wood structures.",
    "Content": "The course includes an introduction to specific material properties of wood such as its orthotropic structure, its behavior under moisture, fire and load duration. Topics covered are instability problems, displacements, transverse tension/compression, geometries with varying cross-sections, curved geometries, moisture-related stresses and deformations, reinforcement of brittle failure modes, design of moment-resistant and screwed connections, determination of connection slip and rotational slip modulus, and composite structures. The course will be a combination of short lectures, independent study and design work. The design project includes the determination of loads and calculation of structures based on relevant standards and literature.",
