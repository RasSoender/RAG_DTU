    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the student broad knowledge of filamentous fungi of significance for the biotech and food industry, both as production organisms and as contaminants. The course will give the student a comprehensive insight in how fungi grow and interact within a given system. The student will gain experience in interpretation of experimental data from mycological experiments. The students will get insight into recent developments in fungal strain engineering and synthetic biology. Through group work on specific cases the student will become familiar with retrieval and interpretation of the scientific literature outside the textbook.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand what a fungus is.\nDescribe and sketch the key morphological structures and life cycles in industrial important fungi and fungal model systems.\nPredict the possibilities for fungal growth (qualitatively and quantitatively).\nUnderstand the underlying processes in fungal cell biology and genetics.\nDesign experiments in fungal genetics/strain development/synthetic biology and interpret data.\nDevise strategies for construction of a fungal cell factory with specific properties.\nDescribe and analyze the interactions between fungi and plants, mammals and bacteria.\nPredict the possibilities for production of mycotoxins and evaluate the toxicological aspects of unwanted mold growth in food and biotechnological products.\nRetrieve and interpret data from on-line databases on fungal bioinformatics.\nIdentify and characterize important molds to species level by multidisciplinary methods.\nAssess a mycological subject within industry and pathology, and present the subject to people with mycological experience at an advanced level.\nCreate and present a scientific topic in a poster to an audience.",
