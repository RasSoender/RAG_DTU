    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe student will obtain an understanding of basic principles behind numerical simulations of microstructure evolution in crystalline materials (primarily metals) induced by chemical, mechanical and thermal external loads, including the associated changes in material properties.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDiscuss the principles behind thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and kinetic diffusion simulations\nDescribe the principles behind the technique of linear programming\nExplain the role of chance in Monte Carlo Simulations\nImplement thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and diffusion simulations for solution of problems involving complex phase equilibria\nImplement linear programming in crystal plasticity simulations\nImplement Monte Carlo techniques to simulate grain growth and recrystallization\nRelate the results of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and diffusion simulations or linear programming to real microstructures\nAssess results of Monte Carlo simulations and potential artifacts\nPresent different simulation methods and the obtained results orally",
    "Content": "The course is taught in three modules with each of duration of one week focused on 1) thermodynamic calculations, 2) linear programming and 3) Monte Carlo simulations. At the end of each module, the students will present the results of a small project to the teachers and the other students. The weekly projects will focus on application of the simulation methods of the module to a materials science problem. The course introduces the mentioned simulation techniques and the students will implement these to address specific problems of complex phase equilibria, deformation-induced evolution of crystallographic texture and mechanical properties, and microstructural evolution during recrystallization and grain growth. The simulations will be compared to real microstructures.",
