    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course gives the student in-depth knowledge and practical experience with industry leading Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies by working on cutting-edge projects in small groups. Project work comprises all stages of a project, including planning and performing relevant laboratory investigations as well as interpretation of experimental results.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe various industrial AM technologies and their associated sub-systems\nEvaluate the applicability of various AM technologies for production of complex geometrical components\nExplain the common applications of each type of AM technology across various industries\nFormulate the tasks necessary to fulfil a project focused on a specific AM technology\nPerform a literature review and interpret the latest findings within state-of-the-art for a specific AM technology\nExplain the process-structure-property relationships for a specific AM technology\nExplain the influence of material composition and properties on the manufacturability of said material in a specific AM technology\nPropose a plan to utilize a specific AM technology within a research project",
    "Content": "The students will gain hands-on experience using one of the several possible AM technologies. The different types of AM technologies available are\n1. Mask-projection vatphotopolymerization using polymers\n2. Mask-projection vatphotopolymerization using slurries infused with metals and/or ceramics\n3. Metal Laser Powder Bed Fusion\n4. Polymer Laser Powder Bed Fusion\n5. Binder Jetting using metals and ceramics\n6. Extrusion-based Additive Manufacturing\n\nThe students will go through the entire manufacturing process chain including design, simulation, slicing, build preparation, AM, post-process cleaning and finishing, post-process heat and surface treatments followed by materials characterization. Each group will focus on one or several aspects of a specific AM process to perform experiment-based research to further the stated goals of the project.",
