    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course you will learn about probabilistic models of cognitive processes. You will gain proficiency in analysing data from behavioral psychophysical experiments using signal detection theory and the psychometric function. We will analyse these standard methods and realise that they rooted in underlying models and assumptions. Subsequently, we will see that these models can be fit into a broader Bayesian modeling framework, which we will use to build custom probabilistic models of cognitive processes.\n\nThe course will also delve into linear models of neural encoding of information and how we can use these models to decode neural representations from behavioral data.\n\nA significant focus of this course lies in mastering the fitting and evaluation of customised probabilistic models using the maximum likelihood principle and numerical optimisation. Proficiency in coding, particularly in Python or MATLAB, is expected from students. Additionally, a foundational understanding of probability theory is important. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on the ability to construct custom models, minimising reliance on pre-existing functions and toolboxes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse data from psychophysical data using signal detection theory and the psychometric function\nAnalyse perception from a Bayesian perspective\nAnalyse linear models of neural coding\nDescribe the relationship between neural and cognitive models\nFit a custom probabilistic model of a cognitive process to behavioural data\nEvaluate custom probabilistic model using cross-validation\nSimulate data from a probabilistic model\nUse simulated data to evaluate model and parameter recovery\nDesign experiments to test probabilistic models of cognitive processes\nDiscuss the relation between qualitative and quantitative models of cognitive processes",
    "Content": "The topics of the course are introduced in weekly lectures. Great emphasis is placed on practical work where students gain proficiency in fitting and evaluating custom probabilistic models of cognitive processes through project work and exercises.\n\nThe course does not include mandatory assignments, and participation in course activities is strongly recommended, but optional. Nonetheless, students will have the chance to receive feedback on their project work and exercises.",
