    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo develop an understanding of the relation between a molecular description of matter and thermodynamical properties and reaction kinetics in order to enable the participants to make theoretical calculations of termodynamic properties and chemical reactions, including rate constants.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the content of the basic axioms in statistical mechanics and the significance of ensembles.\nExplain the connection between thermodynamic functions and the partition function.\nDetermine the partition function for simple systems that are described by quantum mechanics or by classical mechanics.\nDetermine the partition function for any system that is described by classical mechanics.\nExplain the meaning of the entropy on the basis of an atomic description of thermodynamic systems.\nCalculate thermodynamic functions for ideal gasses of monatomic and polyatomic molecules and the equilibrium constant for chemical equilibrium in the gas phase.\nExplain the description of chemical elementary reactions on an atomic level.\nExplain the background for and meaning of potential energy surfaces.\nCalculate rate constants for bimolecular reactions based on the transition-state theory.\nCalculate rate constants for unimolecular reactions at a given total energy and at a given temperature.\nExplain the influence of the solvent, when a chemical reaction takes place in the condensed phase.",
    "Content": "Basic classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. The ensemble concept, partition functions and their application to the calculation of thermodynamic properties. The gas phase and calculation of equilibrium constants for chemical reactions. The crystalline state. Elementary chemical reactions. Atomic and molecular interactions, potential energy surfaces. Dynamics for uni- and bi- molecular reactions. Transition-state theory and calculation of rate constants for uni-(RRKM theory) and bi-molecular reactions. Interpretation of the activation energy. Theory for reactions in solution. Experimental techniques in the microscopic description of chemical reactions, including femtosecond chemistry.",
    "Course literature": "N.E. Henriksen and F.Y. Hansen, Theories of Molecular Reaction Dynamics (Oxford University Press) and notes on statistical thermodynamics.",
    "Remarks": "The course (previous name: Advanced Physical Chemistry) gives the molecular foundation for thermodynamics and reaction kinetics. It includes a general part, statistical mechanics, which provides the connection between a thermodynamic macroscopic description and a molecular microscopic description of equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems as well as systems with chemical reactions. A second part of the course includes a microscopic description of elementary chemical reactions both under conditions with and without thermal equilibrium.\nThe course provides also a foundation for application of the topics mentioned above in various areas of chemistry and for courses like: Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning (26255) and Statistical Thermodynamics for Chemical Engineering (28917).",
