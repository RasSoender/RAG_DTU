    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give practical experience in hydrogen energy systems. Key materials and components from the whole hydrogen chain are addressed by fabrication of catalysts, membranes, and electrodes. Construction of testing devices includes methanol reformer, water electrolysis cell and polymer membrane fuel cells. In this way, the course is meant to address a broader range of knowledge from fundamental materials to hydrogen energy technologies. The theoretical grounds for the techniques are established through a series of short introductory lectures.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPrepare catalyst, membrane and electrodes for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell\nAssemble and test a PEM fuel cell\nSynthesize reforming catalyst and construct a methanol reformer\nTest methanol reforming for hydrogen generation\nPrepare catalyst, electrodes and cells to water electrolysis\nTest a polymer electrolyzer for water splitting\nIntegrate fuel cell with methanol reformer\nExplain fundamental knowledge of electrochemistry and energy technologies",
    "Content": "The course is formulated into three projects and a group report is expected for each project:\nProject 1. Preparation and characterization of platinum catalyst, ion conducting membrane, electrodes, and a polymer fuel cell.\nProject 2. Preparation of methanol reforming catalyst. Construction of laboratory reactor (reformer) with measurement and control of temperature. Test of methanol reformer. Integration and operation of fuel cells and reformer.\nProject 3. Preparation and characterization of catalyst and electrodes and test of water electrolyzer.",
    "Course literature": "In the course we only use teaching material - textbooks, assignments, articles, etc.- that is available free of charge from the course homepage on DTU Learn.",
    "Remarks": "The course is important for special courses and experimental research and development work in the MSc thesis within energy conversion technologies. Safety in the lab is of paramount importance and lab coat and safety glasses are mandatory during all exercises. The students are encouraged to bring lab coat and safety glasses, but it is also possible for some to borrow.",
