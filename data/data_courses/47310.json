    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThrough a series of lectures, group work, computational and laboratory exercises, the students will learn about the basic principles of batteries and will be able to describe the fundamental mechanisms and components of batteries. They will also be able to model, analyze and interpret electrochemical properties and degradation mechanisms for different battery chemistries subject to various operating conditions, and to understand critical issues in the selection of materials and components for cells. Furthermore, the students will know the advantages/disadvantages of batteries compared with other energy storage technologies and will be acquainted with various designs and their advantages/disadvantages as well as application areas.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the fundamentals of a battery cell\nExplain the similarities and differences between types of batteries and battery chemistries\nExplain the mechanisms and functionalities of the individual components of batteries\nApply the critical parameters in the selection of materials\nAssess the critical parameters in the selection of operating conditions\nAnalyze data describing the electrochemical performance of batteries\nCalculate the energy efficiency\nExplain possible degradation mechanisms leading to decrease in cell performance\nDescribe advantages and disadvantages of different types of batteries in comparison with other energy storage technologies\nApply computational modelling to describe battery materials and mechanisms\nUnderstand the principles of working safely in the laboratory",
    "Content": "The principles of various battery types and chemistries. Methods for a theoretical description of the fundamental properties of battery cells and battery materials. Materials demands and limitations of the individual components, i.e. electrolyte, anode and cathode materials. Challenges for the assembled cells related to materials and interfaces will be discussed in a chemical and structural context. Characterization and evaluation of cell properties by, e.g., electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Structural and microstructural description of battery materials. Description/studies of degradation mechanisms for state-of-the-art Li-ion and metal-air batteries. Discussions of future (beyond lithium-ion) batteries. The students will assemble a rechargeable battery. Electrochemical characterization will be done using, e.g. galvanostatic charge/discharge, and the effect of high current on overpotential and capacity will be investigated.\nThe students will also perform computational modelling using density functional theory of the overpotentials in a lithium-air cell and/or ionic transport in lithium-ion battery materials.",
    "Course literature": "In the course we only use teaching material - textbooks, assignments, articles, etc.- that is available free of charge via e.g. www, DTU Library, DTU Learn.",
