    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course is focused on providing a structured vision of geometrical metrology as the decisional basis for controlling design, manufacture, and function, and a basic discipline, which can serve as powerful tool to solve industrial, as well as scientific problems. The course encompasses a number of hands on activities concerning the use of measurement instruments, data processing and analyses of industrial problems. The quality assurance of measurements is emphasized in the context of the metrological infrastructure at company, national, and international level.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nList and select suitable measurement instruments according to specifications\nExplain the metrological traceability and interpret the metrological properties accuracy and precision\nAssess the measurement uncertainty and the traceability for dimensional and geometric measurements when several methods and instruments are used\nVerify dimensional, geometric, and roughness tolerance requirements\nClassify and relate to relevant international documents, with particular focus on the concepts and elements of the international Geometrical Product Specifications (ISO GPS) system of standards\nRelate and assess roughness parameters using profile and areal methods\nSummarize methods for testing manufacturing machines\nPlan and discuss data presentation and reporting",
    "Content": "1) The international system of units (SI); 2) Measurement uncertainty and traceability; 3) Geometrical Product Specifications; 4) Coordinate metrology (measurements on CMMs); 5) Digitalization and Reverse Engineering; 6) Surface metrology; 7) Technologies for optical metrology; 8) Tolerance verification; 9) Machine testing.",
