    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the student with extensive practical experience in molecular biological, genetic and physiological handling of eukaryotes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPerform classic molecular biology/genetics experiments.\nDescribe DNA maintenance as well as chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cells. This includes using fundamental molecular genetic terms.\nHandle yeasts and/or filamentous fungi.\nPlan and coordinate several experiments simultaneously.\nConstruct new strains by gene targeting and/or CRISPR gene editing.\nChange a eukaryotic genome by introducing point mutations, deletions, GFP tags or other genomic modifications.\nPerform calculations based on the results derived from the various experiments performed.\nAnalyze and interpret experimental results obtained from the various experiments performed in the course.\nPresent and explain experimental results obtained during the course for an audience.",
    "Content": "Yeasts and molds are often used as model organisms in basic research and as cell factories in industrial processes. This laboratory course focuses on construction of yeast and filamentous fungal strains using genetic engineering. This involves classical genetic and molecular biology based methods as well as modern CRISPR technology. In the course, students work in small teams, each aiming at developing their own strain or set of strains. The typical task is to delete or insert specific genes in order to make strains that allow a specific biological question to be addressed. The individual projects therefore constitute a miniature research project. Hence, based on a specific scientific question new strains will be constructed. Subsequent characterization of the strains will then address the initial question asked. The projects will typically involve baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or a filamentous fungus like Aspergillus niger. The genetic modifications will be implemented by using a state of the art genetic tool box containing “bio blocks” like promoters, reporter genes, terminators, The course will finish with small presentations, where student teams present their biological question, the experimental strategy, as well as their results in a session including the entire class. The performance in the course, including the presentations, will then be evaluated as pass/not pass.",
    "Remarks": "This course is recommended after course 27230 and 27430.",
