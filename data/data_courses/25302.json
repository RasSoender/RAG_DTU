    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course gives students a general introduction to the physics the world’s oceans, shelf seas and estuaries. The course will focus on marine environments, knowledge that can be used both as a platform for more advanced studies of the topic, as a contribution to their development in marine ecology, fisheries and/or aquaculture, and provide a scientific background to sustainable development goals: 13 climate action and 14 life under water.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify the major components affecting seawater density, calculate it using the equation of state, and calculate its dynamic influence on fluid flow.\nIdentify the major factors affecting shelf sea dynamics – inflow, winds, tides – and calculate the position of mixing fronts.\nIdentify the physical processes contributing to the spring bloom.\nDescribe the various instruments and technologies involved in ocean observation systems.\nUse modern software applications (Ocean Data View) to analyse oceanographic data.\nConstruct and interpret box models of through-flow systems such as estuaries to examine the fate of nutrients and contaminants.\nCalculate the magnitude of geostrophic currents, Ekman pumping, and upwelling, and explain the influence of these on marine productivity.\nExplain the major features of wind driven surface circulation, atmosphere-ocean coupling, the meridional overturn circulation and their influence on climate.",
    "Content": "Physical properties of seawater.\nOceanic heat budget.\nDynamics of density & wind driven flows, tides, and waves.\nSeasonal cycles of stratification and mixing; the spring bloom and tidal mixing fronts.\nEstuaries and semi-enclosed basins.\nPlanetary rotation, and geostrophy.\nWind driven ocean circulation\nDescriptive Regional Oceanography\nThe meridional overturn circulation\nPaleo-oceanography\nOceans and climate.",
