    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo apply standard criteria and methods to design ventilation- and climatic systems that satisfy human requirements and to suggest strategies for control of such systems to achieve low energy use. To evaluate the design by advanced numerical and experimental methods with emphasis on characterization of air distribution in spaces.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUse standards and professional literature to specify criteria to the indoor environment and quantify cooling, heating and pollution loads\nSelect a ventilation principle and design a ventilation system based on requirements to the indoor environment, energy use, and space geometry and usage\nDescribe psychrometric states and processes in climatic systems, including heat recovery, heating, cooling, humidification and dehumidification of ventilation air\nExplain the physics of airflow in spaces and ducts\nDescribe the aerodynamic characteristics of air terminal devices which are commonly used for room air distribution and their selection procedures\nCarry out simulations of air distribution, indoor environment and energy use by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and other numerical tools and critically evaluate the output; apply the solutions to predict and describe the indoor environment and energy use and to optimize the ventilation design\nPlan and execute a larger experimental task in a full-scale mock-up including use of instrumentation for the measurement of air change, ventilation effectiveness, air speed and temperature\nAnalyze and evaluate indoor environmental quality parameters from experimental data and simulation output\nDescribe energy efficient operation and control strategies for ventilation and climatic systems\nCarry out a larger, coherent design project in groups of 3-4 students and present the work in written and oral form",
    "Content": "Criteria to comfortable indoor environments. Load calculations. Psychrometrics in climatic systems. Components and types of system. Analysis of energy use. Strategies for operation and control. Numerical simulation of climatic systems, indoor environment and energy use. Ventilation principles and systems. Theory and modeling of isothermal and non-isothermal airflow in spaces. Airflow near humans. CFD-modeling. Comfort ventilation. Natural ventilation. Hybrid ventilation. Infiltration. Measurement instruments. Measurement of airflow in spaces. Tracer gas measurements.",
    "Remarks": "The students will design a climatic system for a building that has well-defined requirements to the indoor environment. By simulation, it will be tested whether the system meets the energy requirements. CFD-simulation and full-scale measurements with advanced methods will be performed to test the validity of the design.",
