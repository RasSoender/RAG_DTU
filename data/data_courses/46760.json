    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe term Smart Grid is used to describe the vision of a future energy system that incorporates a large share of renewable energy sources into a highly automated, flexible and reliable system.\nExamples of Smart Grid technologies are household appliances that react intelligently to varying system conditions, automatic mechanisms for coordination of resources, and advanced information exchange systems.\nThe objective of this course is to gain hands-on experience with technologies used in such systems, by designing, implementing and testing a Smart Grid application on a microcontroller system.\nThe smart energy systems are used as a case for the application, but no previous experience with energy systems is required from the students.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nunderstand the basic concepts of Smart Grids/Smart Energy Systems\nanalyze the requirements of a Smart Grid/Smart Energy System application\ndesign an application that uses inputs and outputs to interact with a physical device\ndesign a user interface for local control and monitoring\ndesign a communication interface for remote control and monitoring\nimplement the application on a microcontroller system\ndesign a test procedure that utilizes laboratory facilities to validate the function of the application\nperform tests in the laboratory\ndocument the entire process and the developed application",
    "Content": "Most of the time, the students will work in the laboratory in project teams.\nIntroductory lectures are given on:\n- Smart Grids/Smart Energy Systems and related ICT technology\n- Specific Smart Grid/Smart Energy System applications (projects)\n- Arduino MKR1000/1010 microcontroller system and its peripherals (A/D and D/A converters, Timer, I/O, Interrupte, and LCD display, etc.)\n- The integrated development environment Arduino Embedded Workbench\n- Communication systems in smart energy systems\n- User-centered interface design",
