    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course should provide the students with tools to evaluate possible changes in construction materials, with the aim of CO2 reduction and resource consumption, by understanding the link between material production, material properties, and durability.\nMapping properties and risk will be crucial for the expected service environment and is essential for both materials experts and designers of structures.\n\nIn the first half of the course, the students will be introduced to methods that allow measuring and modelling of material properties and how to analyze changes in production processes, in an attempt to accommodate more sustainable production processes, based on success criteria like the reduction of CO2 or reduced waste production. This part will conclude with a multiple-choice test to verify a sufficient overview of these topics.\n\nIn the second half of the course, the students will be introduced to different example materials, which may vary from year to year. Additionally, the students will be working in groups on their own, selected material that must be affected by changes in production processes to reach sustainability goals. For example, if cement is replaced by a secondary resource: What does this mean for the durability or recyclability of the concrete that is produced with this alternative cement?\n\nThe results of the group work should summarise the anticipated changes in the production process, the resulting changes in material properties and possible durability risks, and argue for how this could be measured or verified before it is used in the market in a report and presented in the course (last date of the semester).\n\nThis course will be an excellent introduction to an experimental thesis in the context of sustainable materials.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the analytical strengths and weaknesses of common experimental and modelling methods to assess the properties and durability of common construction materials\nAnalyse the production processes of common construction materials and their changes caused by changing priorities\nIdentify the corresponding material changes based on principles of materialscience\nQuantify the corresponding material changes\nDetermine subsequent risks for function of the chosen material\nIdentify problematic consequences for the material durability\nPlan a strategy to test the suitability of the target material for each group for it's intended service environment\nReport the production changes for the group's material, the risk assessment and measurement strategy in a short report and presentation",
    "Content": "1) Influence of the priority changes through the Green Transition on construction materials and design decisions/processes\n2) Influence of CO2 reduction and circular concepts on construction material flows and materials properties\n3) Material structure and properties: standardization and testing methods today\n4) Material performance: Modelling approaches\n5) Material performance: Linking the scales from nano to macro\n6) Risk analysis models and approaches.\n7) Example cases will be presented for selected construction materials\n8) Use of new materials in the engineering application",
