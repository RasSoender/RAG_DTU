    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course objective is to familiarize students with environmental noise issues by working with current and realistic noise problems from the internal and the external environment, including occupational issues. The aim is also to enable the participants to evaluate possible solutions and describe this in a poster to a (virtual) client/customer. At the end of the course, the students should be able to perform a noise investigation, operate noise-measurement equipment, justify the metrics used in a given situation, describe the results and relate them to environmental noise regulations and potential effects of noise on human health.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nclassify environmental noise sources\nevaluate potential health effects of noise exposure depending on the nature and level of the sound source\nanalyze traffic, industrial, and workplace noise and quantify their degree of annoyance\ndescribe noise limits for different areas\ndescribe outdoor sound propagation and explain by which factors it is influenced\nplan and perform a noise investigation\njustify the metrics used as noise indicators for the chosen situation\nrelate the investigation results to noise regulations, perceived annoyance, and potential health effects\nevaluate possible means for reduction of the noise\ncommunicate the motivation, methods, results, and interpretation of the noise investigation",
    "Content": "Human hearing in relation to annoyance and risk of hearing damage due to noise exposure. Types of environmental noise sources. Noise exposure metrics. Acoustic regulation of workrooms. Outdoor sound propagation and noise screens. Noise from roads, railways and airports. Noise from industrial plants. Environmental requirements for noise and vibration. Sound insulation of windows and facades. Sound level measurements and noise analysis. On-site noise investigation.",
    "Remarks": "If overbooked priority is given to DTU students.",
