    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo train the participants in synthesis of system elements by carrying out an engineering project in telecommunication. To train the participants in rational group work on a development task.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIndependently analyze open ended problems and identify, delineate, and implement solutions in collaboration across both professional and personal competencies.\nIndependently conduct relevant and critical information search and review to independently increase one's level of knowledge regarding the issue\nCommunicate technical information, theories, and results both graphically, in writing, and orally, and present it to different groups of stakeholders.\nEvaluate one's own and others' developed solutions in relation to established requirements, including any sustainability criteria and unintended impacts\nEvaluate any unforeseen challenges associated with problem-solving in an engineering project.\nAnalyse and specify a communication technological construction, including analysis and selection of suitable often advanced tools.\nImplement and verify a communication technological construction using appropriate tools\nDocument all phases of a development project from design idea to final product.\nOrganize collaboration in a possibly heterogeneous group, including organizing contact with other groups or users in larger projects",
    "Content": "Project work and development methodology for an engineering product. Selection of projects. Group organization and dynamics. Product specification and description. Independent implementation. Collaboration with external partners. Testing and verification.\nThe possible projects vary but typically include elements from one or more of the areas below:\n- Programmable circuits (FPGA)\n- Signal Processing\n- Software\n- Optical Communication",
    "Remarks": "The course is run together with 34229. As a starting point, the students are divided into groups with only master's students or only bachelor's students, but groups at different levels and with English as a language can be expected",
