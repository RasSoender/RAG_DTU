    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give a thorough introduction to the use of metaheuristics for optimization for solving real-world optimizaton problems, where a trade-off is necessary between solution quality and solution time.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSolve complex and/or large optimization problems using meta-heuristics.\nIdentify what are the most appropriate meta-heuristics for a specific optimization problem.\nDevice a problem representation that allows a specific problem to be optimized using a meta-heuristic.\nSpecialize a meta-heuristic such that it can be applied to a specific optimization problem.\nImplement a metaheuristic such that it can be applied to a specific optimization problem.\nTest a meta-heuristic such that its efficiency can be reliably evaluated.\nDescribe in written form the adaptation of a meta-heuristic to a specific problem formulation.\nUnderstand the difference between the diversification and intensification strategies of different meta-heuristic frameworks.",
    "Content": "Many interesting optimization problems cannot be solved using standard solvers dues to their size and complexity.\n\nA pragmatic approach to optimization is to use tailored computer algorithms to test a large number of solutions in order to find a good feasible solution. Such algorithms are called heuristics. Those algorithms do not guarantee to find optimal solutions but attempt to identify good solutions. There exist a number of more general algorithmic frameworks which can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems. Those are the so-called meta-heuristics. In this course a number of these meta-heuristics will be presented:\n\n- Simulated Annealing\n- Genetic Algorithms/Evolutionary Algorithms\n- TABU search\n- GRASP\n- ALNS\n- ILS\n\nAs this field is constantly developing, the content of the course is constantly updated. The exercises in the course will be in the computing language Julia, hence prior experience with Julia is an advantage.",
