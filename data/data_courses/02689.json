    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe use of model-based simulation tools on modern computers are increasingly being used in academia and industry for improving engineering designs and decision support.\nThe course goal is to give a solid grounding in the developments of theory and practice in the use of advanced numerical computational methods for efficient solution of differential equations and for prediction in science and engineering. This includes development, analysis and application of advanced numerical methods and algorithms for the solution of any type of differential equations (fx. ODEs/PDEs/SDEs). We will develop and generalize ideas from finite difference methods, Fourier methods and extend them to modern and flexible multi-domain methods such as Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Methods and Spectral Element Methods. The experience gained in the course is useful for the numerical solution and prediction and study of mathematical problems where no analytical solutions exist or are readily obtainable. The methods are suitable for scientific computing, high performance computing (HPC) and is relevant for topics in modern Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and data-driven Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). The last project in the course can be defined in a scientific area of relevance to the participant.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply basic principles for numerical approximation/discretization of spectral methods.\nApply the Fourier Transforms.\nAnalyze convergence and stability properties of spectral methods.\nSetup and solve boundary value problems for partial differential equations.\nImplement methods for time integration of semi-discrete equation systems.\nImplement and apply algorithms for periodic and non-periodic problems.\nConstruct spektral approximations for partial derivatives.\nImplement spektral methods in Matlab.\nWrite reports and clearly communicate, discuss and draw conclusions based on main ideas and results.",
    "Content": "Subjects that will be covered in the course includes:\n- Spektral approximation methods\n- Fourier approximations methods (periodic)\n- Polynomial approximation methods (non-periodic)\n- Time-integration and stability analysis\n- Solution of Linear and Nonlinear PDE problems\n- Numerical solution of dynamical systems\n- Consistency and convergence properties for spectral methods\n- Numerical integration\n- Derivation and analysis of advanced algorithms (fx. via projects)",
