    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the participants with a framework within statistical methodology, in order to understand concepts in genetics that in nature are probabilistic, in this context. A special emphasis will be devoted to inference on issues such as linkage disequilibrium and similar concepts in inheritance models.The course will also focus on obtaining methods within statistics and probability theory, with the aim of applications within the area of the course.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPossess the knowledge, skills and tools needed to read current theoretical, methodological and applied literature in Statistical Genetics, to understand methods, and to interpret analyses.\nUnderstand Mendelian inheritance in a probabilistic framework.\nUnderstand the practical implementation of basic statistical and probabilistic methods within statistical genetics.\nBe able to work with methods from statistical genetics in practice.\nIdentify procedures for estimation of allele frequencies, recombination frequencies, and other genetic parameters underlying observations on Mendelian traits.\nSet up models for linkage equilibrium and disequilibrium, and perform the corresponding analyses.\nPerform association studies for selected disease traits and genetic markers.\nEstimate the degree to which a certain phenotype may be explained based on genotype.\nModel genetic data at population level with mathematical and statistical models.\nEvaluate which statistical model that best explains a given data set relevant for the course contents.\nBe able to lead a discussion among peers on topics of statistical genetics.",
    "Content": "Basic concepts of molecular genetics; genetic models; allele frequencies estimation; population substructure; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; testing equilibrium models; heritibility analyses; linkage analysis; genetic association; codominant, recessive and dominant models; power functions; genetic distance; adaption and control of statistical models; predictions.",
    "Course literature": "Laird NM and Lange C:The Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Genetics, Springer 2011.",
    "Remarks": "Even though the course does not have formal requirements in probability theory, the applications demand a high degree of educational maturity, and an interest in linking biology and statistics/probability.",
