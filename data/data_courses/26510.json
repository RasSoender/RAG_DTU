    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAn interdisciplinary course which will give students a fundamental understanding of various main type catalysts, and knowledge of principles and methodologies applicable to obtain ressource effecient and sustainable chemical reactions.\nThe student should be able to synthesize different main type catalysts, characterize the structure of the materials on the nanometer scale and test the materials for catalytic activity, thus allowing them to establish structure-performance relationships.\nFurthermore, it is expected that the student will be able to assess the sustainability of catalytic processes after completing the course.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the most important industrial catalytic processes and catalysts\ndescribe the concepts of green and sustainable chemistry and use these to assess the sustainability of industrially catalyzed processes\ndescribe catalytic processes at nano-, meso- and macro-levels\nwrite a possible reaction mechanism for a catalyzed reaction and explain the electronic and steric factors which have influence on the reaction\nprepare selected heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts for fluegas cleaning and chemicals production\ntest selected heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts and determine how the behavior is related to intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the catalysts\nselect possible physico-chemical techniques to characterize heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts and use these to establish relationship between structure and catalytic performance\nindependently acquire knowledge about catalysis and catalysts from literature, and communicate this orally\nperform group work and independently present the results of a project and thereby illustrate key experimental and theoretical aspects of catalysis and sustainability",
    "Content": "Lectures, discussions in groups, and laboratory projects will combine to cover a broad range of subjects, e.g. main type catalysts and catalytic effects, preparation methods, reaction kinetics, process design, characterization techniques and structure and reactivity of model catalysts and industrial catalysts. Furthermore, a number of concepts of green and sustainable chemistry will be dealt with in relation to environmentally benign energy and chemicals production, e.g. multi-phase catalysis, life-cycle assessment and alternative reaction media.\nThe practical projects in the course will to some extent be part of the research performed at the Department of Chemistry where the students are expected to search the relevant literature.",
