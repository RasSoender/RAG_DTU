    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of exoplanet science, focusing on the detection, demographics, and atmospheric characterization of exoplanets. Students will gain practical experience in handling real astronomical data, employing various data analysis techniques, and using Python for scientific computing. The objective is to equip students with the necessary skills to conduct independent research, emphasizing hands-on experience with actual datasets and analytical methods.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the fundamental principles and techniques used in the detection of exoplanets, with a particular focus on transit and radial velocity methods.\nCharacterize exoplanetary atmospheres using spectroscopic data, interpreting the results in terms of chemical composition and physical conditions.\nAnalyze exoplanet demographics and understand the significance of these populations within the context of planetary formation and evolution theories.\nAssess the habitability potential of exoplanets by examining their physical and orbital characteristics, applying criteria for the habitable zone, and considering the implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.\nApply statistical methods to estimate error bars and assess the reliability of inferred exoplanetary parameters.\nUtilize Python programming for data fitting, including the development of scripts to model observational data and extract scientifically relevant information.\nCritically evaluate scientific literature on exoplanetary research, identifying key challenges and areas for future investigation.\nEngage in data-driven research projects, demonstrating the ability to formulate hypotheses, analyze data, and communicate findings effectively.",
    "Content": "The course is structured to provide both a strong theoretical foundation and practical experience in exoplanet science. The course will begin with a week of lectures and hands-on exercises. During this week, the focus will be on the core principles of exoplanet detection, demographics, and atmospheres. Following this, the course will focus on hands-on project-based analysis of real astronomical data, employing various data analysis techniques. Students will be able to conduct radial velocity mass determination of exoplanets, discovery and radius determination of transiting planets, and/or spectroscopic study of exoplanetary atmospheres to determine atmospheric composition, temperature, and other critical physical properties.\nThe initial week sets the stage for a two-week group project phase, where students will apply their learning to a specific research question within the scope of the course. Each group will choose a topic, conduct a detailed investigation using real data, and utilize Python for data analysis and modeling. This project phase emphasizes collaboration, critical thinking, and the application of statistical methods to estimate uncertainties and validate findings.\nThe course culminates in oral exam with will evaluate the students' ability to conduct independent research, analyze and interpret data, and communicate scientific results effectively. Through this combination of lectures, exercises, and project-based learning, students will gain skills and knowledge necessary to conduct independent research.",
    "Remarks": "This course provides students with competencies relevant to UN SDGs, e.g.,#13 (Climate Action), #14 (Life below water) and #15 (Life on land).",
