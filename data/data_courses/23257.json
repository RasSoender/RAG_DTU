    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course introduces to the mathematical tools that are required to analyze, visualize, and interpret genomic (compositional) count data. Data, which describes proportions, counts, percentages, or concentrations are compositional and cannot be analyzed as real multivariate data. However, using appropriate transformations, compositional data can be projected into a multivariate real space, on which we can use all available standard multivariate methods.\nThe objectives of this course are to let the students understand the mathematical principles behind compositions, and asses the quality of genomic data. The students will learn how to perform explorative data analysis and visualize compositions, and finally how to use standard statistical methods in a compositional framework.\nApart from the study of genomics, compositional data are encountered in broad range of study fields (e.g., geology, chemistry, political sciences, environmental studies, health science, etc.) and this course is therefore relevant for any student who has an interest in general data science.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify compositional data and remember the basic mathematical rules that apply to such data\nDescribe the difference between compositional and non-compositional data\nDescribe and use the basic algebraic concepts, such as distance metrics, vector spaces, and log-ratio transformations\nUse the appropriate transformation techniques to explore compositional data\nUse Bayesian techniques to analyze sparse compositions\nVisualize compositional data\nPerform hypothesis testing on compositional data\nPerform exploratory analysis of compositional data using PCA\nDescribe time-resolved compositional data as a compositional process\nDefend the general use of CoDa methods in genomic data analysis",
    "Content": "This course gives an interdisciplinary introduction to compositional data analysis and modeling. While the course will mainly be anchored in applications to genomic data analysis, we will, throughout the course, draw examples from a variety of other topics. We will work through the mathematical framework during lectures and apply the techniques to real world examples during hand-on exercises.",
    "Remarks": "Students are expected to have prior knowledge of linear algebra and statistics, and basic programing skills in Python, R or Matlab.\nTowards the end of the course, students will pick a compositional data set, which they will analyze and visualize based on the techniques they have learned. The result should be handed in as a written report and students will present their reports as part of an individual oral examination.",
