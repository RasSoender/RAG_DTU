    "Department": "23 National Food Institute",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall aim of this course is to give an in-depth theoretical background and practical hands-on training within green extraction and processing technologies which are important for producing food ingredients from different raw materials and side streams.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the importance of green processing technologies.\nDiscuss how the different green extraction technologies contribute to green transition and sustainability.\nDescribe the principles and mechanisms of the different green extraction technologies.\nOperate and use the processing equipment for the extraction of ingredients.\nDesign an experimental plan for practical exercise.\nPerform extraction of the specific compound from a given raw material.\nCalculate the extraction yield and measure the level of a specific compound.\nDiscuss and report the obtained results in a report.",
    "Content": "The course will teach the student how to understand the principles of the different green extraction technologies (such as ultrasound-assisted extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, supercritical CO2 extraction, subcritical water extraction, and pulsed electric field treatment). The course will also teach the students how to apply the theoretical understanding in practice to extract different ingredients from raw materials. Furthermore, the students determine the extraction yield of the extract and measure and quantify the main compound(s) in the extract.\nThe teaching will be a mix of active learning through presentations, design of practical experiment plan in groups (4 students), performing the practical experiments, and writing reports.",
    "Remarks": "The course is a 3-week elective course on the master program Food Technology. The student is required to be at DTU for the whole 3 weeks from 8-17. If the course is oversubscribed a preference will be given to DTU students from master in Food Technology.",
