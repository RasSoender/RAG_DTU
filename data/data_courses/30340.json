    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course emphasizes system aspects and deals with two important microwave sensors - radar and radiometer systems - used for remote sensing and surveillance. The aim is that the student will eventually be able to perform a proper system analysis and design of radar and radiometer systems for various applications.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndiscuss radar equation and analyze its concequences\ndemonstrate and analyze MTI and Tracking radars\nanalyse and develop pulse compression techniques\nanalyse and design radar systems\nanalyse and design SAR techniques\nanalyse and design ice sounding radars\ndiscuss and analyse radiometer types\ndiscuss imaging radiometer systems\nanalyse and design radiometer systems\norganize project work\nwrite technical report.",
    "Content": "The course will describe systems like airport traffic control radar, weather radar, air- and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and ice sounding radar. The theory behind the systems is described, and the systems are worked through on a block diagram level. Likewise, radiometer systems are introduced: What is radiometry, radiometer principles, imaging radiometer systems, and polarimetric radiometer. The course is strongly related to the sensor development taking place at DTU Space within airborne SAR and radiometer.",
    "Remarks": "The course is closely related to 30350 Remote Sensing.",
