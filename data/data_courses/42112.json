    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable students to solve large operations research problems using mathematical models and standard software. This entails formulating a mathematical optimization model, using the standard modelling language Julia/JuMP and solvers to solve the model, evaluate alternatives, and finally be able to describe results and conclusions from a mathematical model. Since the various standard programs for mathematical modelling are rather similar, the knowledge gained is not restricted to the software employed here.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze decision problems to identify the problem type and formulate an appropriate mathematical model\nFormulate Linear Programming Problems\nFormulate Mixed Integer Linear Programming Problems\nUnderstand and formulate Stochastic Programming models\nImplement Stochastic Programming models and solve them with Julia/JuMP\nUnderstand and formulate Multi-Objective models\nImplement Multi-Objective models and solve them with Juia/JuMP\nEvaluate the solutions obtained with Julia/JuMP",
    "Content": "The theoretical background from Introduction to Operations Research (42101) is supplemented by introducing a standard program modelling system for formulating and solving mathematical models, i.e. Linear Programming models, Integer Linear Programming models, and biobjective optimization problems. The exercises used in the course increase in difficulty as the course progresses.",
    "Course literature": "A freely available course book",
    "Remarks": "NOTE:\n\nThe official start date is 6/1 2025. We expect all student to show up on there first day of the course.\n\nBefore the course we expect all students to have Julia/JuMP and VS-code installed on their computer and have tried to execute basic LP/MIP models in Julia/JuMP before the start of the course.\n\nWe will send self study material with exercises in our welcome email. Students whose OR experience is a bit rusty, can benefit (a lot) from doing these exercises before the course.\n\nWe expect ALL students who participate in the course to know the basics of Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). If you have only little or no experience with LP/MIP and/or Julia/JuMP, you can expect this course TO BE VERY DIFFICULT.",
