    "course title": "22507 Advanced magnetic resonance imaging",
    "Danish title": "Avancerede emner indenfor Magnetisk Resonans billeddannelse",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Biomedical Engineering\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Engineering Physics\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Biomedical Engineering",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E2B (Thurs 8-12)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The central method of education is group discussion of read texts, supplemented with lectures, student presentations, problem solving and practical exercises using DTUs new MR scanner. The course material and exercises are presented by lecturers and alternating participants sharing the load approximately evenly. Overall satisfying contributions in the shape of frequent presentations are a requirement for passing the course.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "F2B",
    "Type of assessment": "Evaluation of exercises/reports\nThe students' academic level with respect to the learning objectives, is assessed based on the mandatory individual presentations and discussions throughout the course, as well as a hand-in assignment. The two parts are weighted equally. No separate exam is held. A single grade is given.",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , internal examiner",
    "Previous Course": "31551",
    "Academic prerequisites": "22506 , The course requires extensive prior MR knowledge corresponding to the end level of DTU course 22506 Medical Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",
    "Participants restrictions": "Minimum 8",
    "Responsible": "Axel Thielscher , Lyngby Campus, Building 349, Ph. (+45) 4525 5313 , axthi@dtu.dk",
    "Course co-responsible": "Lars G. Hanson , Lyngby Campus, Building 349, Ph. (+45) 4525 3686 , lghan@dtu.dk",
    "Department": "22 Department of Health Technology",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nBuilding on the participants' solid knowledge of Magnetic Resonance (MR) from DTU course 22506 or similar, the current course addresses some of the more advanced topics of MR, e.g., of relevance for a career related to MRI or NMR. Mathematical descriptions are supplemented with qualitative understanding of MR instrumentation, acquisition and analysis.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nquantitatively analyze central sequence and tissue parameters of importance for MR Imaging (MRI).\nselect and design radio-frequency pulses for MRI.\ncharacterize, choose and suppress echoes and coherence pathways.\ncharacterize MR instrumentation and address its limitations.\ncharacterize MR contrast agents and calculate determining factors for signal and relaxation, including multi-nuclear MRI.\ndesign multi-echo and undersampling techniques to accelerate MR measurements.\ndesign and analyze functional MRI experiments (fMRI), in particular based on high spatial resolution MRI.\naddress challenges of hyperpolarized and ultra-highfield MR to reap the benefits of such signal enhancing techniques.",
    "Content": "In particular, the course addresses aspects of accelerated imaging, relaxation mechanisms, contrast agents, functional/structural neuroimaging, and ultra-highfield MR. E-learning enters via MR simulations.",
    "Course literature": "The following book is supplemented with texts distributed to participants:\nBernstein, King, and Zhou; Handbook of MRI sequences; Elsevier, 2004\nIt is currently available via DTU Findit.",
    "Remarks": "E-learning is used in the form of simulations. The new clinical MR scanner at DTU is used.",
