    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe goal is to provide insight into the physics of the space environment. The focus will be on the Sun, the interplanetary medium, and the Earth's space environment. The student will acquire basic knowledge of the natural phenomena in space, such as high-energy radiation and the propagation of radio waves. The acquired knowledge also forms the foundation of further studies of the influence of the Sun and the solar wind on the Earth and the other planets, as well as magnetospheric physics and the atmosphere.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nestimate the density and pressure in the upper atmosphere from basic principles\nderive basic equations describing formation of the ionosphere\ncalculate the motion of charged particles in the Earth's magnetosphere, including the radiation belts\nperform simple calculations of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field propagation\ndescribe and estimate effects of the solar wind on planetary environment\nexplain the distribution of plasma and electric currents in the Earth's environment, the plasmasphere and magnetosphere\nuse and exploit wellknown theoretical and empirical models for the space environment\nanalyze satellite data of solar winds that interact with the Earth's magnetosphere.",
    "Content": "Single-particle motion in magnetic and electric fields. MHD theory application to space. Structure and dynamics of the upper atmosphere. Ionospheric formation and structure. Wave propagation in plasma. Solar activity and solar wind. Solar wind planetary interactions. Magnetospheric structure and dynamics. Plasmasphere, aurora and radiation belts.",
    "Course literature": "BASIC SPACE PLASMA PHYSICS, Wolfgang Baumjohann and Rudolf A. Treumann, Imperia1 College Press.\nNotes will be handed out during the course.",
