    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course objective is to enable the student to analyze complex sound fields using analytical, numerical and experimental tools, as well as signal processing methods in acoustics.\n\nWe study sound fields in rooms (modal, statistical, and numerical approaches), wave guides (ducts, musical instruments, headphones) and sound radiation from acoustic sources. We also study microphone array measurements and signal processing (beamforming and acoustic holography), spatial sound, sound field reproduction, and Machine Learning in acoustics. The course aims at providing a deep understanding of acoustic phenomena and methods that are central to modern acoustic engineering.\n\nThe course combines analytical and hands-on experimental activities, with weekly laboratory measurement sessions. There are also a number of guest lectures from researchers, PhDs and industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze the sound field inside a duct at low frequencies, design silencer systems and characterize sound in waveguides, such as headphones or wind instruments.\nExamine the sound field inside a duct, derive the Green's function and explain the propagation of sound inside it.\nAnalyze the sound field in a room based on the modal theory. Derive the Green's function in a room and use it to explain the central acoustic processes that occur in a room.\nExamine the sound field in a room based on statistical wave models, and how these methods are used in practical applications of room acoustics.\nAnalyze and interpret the decay of sound in a room, based on the modal and statistical theories.\nExamine a sound field based on its active and reactive intensity, and evaluate the usefulness and limitations of intensity measurement.\nDescribe the radiation from point sources, and how coherent sources affect each other.\nInterpret the expression for the sound field radiated by a spherical source. Illustrate the use of spherical harmonic expansions for sound radiation and scattering.\nAnalyze the sound field radiated by a planar source, using space domain and wave number domain formulations.\nIllustrate the fundamentals of microphone array methods (beamforming and acoustic holography). Describe how these methods are used to analyze sound fields\nApply Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to problems in acoustics",
