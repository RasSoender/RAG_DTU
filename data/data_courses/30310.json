    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims at teaching a fundamental and holistic approach to the field of systems engineering that applies specifically to complex high-tech industries, like the aerospace industry. The field of systems engineering is highly multidisciplinary, requiring a broad knowledge base and experience to draw from. For complex and wide-ranging projects, like a spacecraft mission, to succeed, a systems engineer's key role and methods are essential to make ends meet and fulfil a mission's requirements.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the fundamental concepts of system engineering and the role of a system engineer – also in an organizational innovation context where knowledge from multiple engineering disciplines is applied and incorporated in system engineering\nlist the elements of a project's/program's life cycle, and explain the role of the stakeholders - including customers’ role in a commercial context\nunderstand how system requirements drive the design, cost, schedule, testing, verification, validation and operation of a system\nformulate a set of driving requirements to fulfill the needs of stakeholders/customer and customers in a market\nassess the impact of a change request to a project requirement\ncalculate an error budget and critically assess the driving requirement\nassess failure mechanism for a system, and identify critical path of project development\nexecute the methodology of system engineering processes\nperform trade studies and compare pros and cons for optimal system realization",
    "Content": "The course consists of two parts: The lecture hours, where the theory, processes and methods for systems engineering are taught, and the group work part, where the students will solve assignments with a focus on applying the methods of system engineering to a given spacecraft project, to bring a project successfully towards a critical design review.",
