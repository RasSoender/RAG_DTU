    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E2B (Thurs 8-12)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The course will consist of lectures, discussions, and practical exercises. It will be structured around three topics, all starting out with an introduction of established knowledge, moving to reading and discussing state-of-the-art papers, and finally a practical case implementation building on the visited methods.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E2B",
    "Type of assessment": "Written and oral examination\n50% of the grade is based on group project assessment. 50% of the grade is based on an exam at the end of the course. If there are sufficiently few students, this will be an individual oral exam. Otherwise, it will be a 2-hour written exam.",
    "Exam duration": "Written exam: 2 hours",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course students will get introduced to ethical challenges in AI and tools to understand and examine them. Main topics of the course are on paradigms and limitations of machine learning (Epistemology), Fairness and bias, and Explainable-AI. Current state-of-the-art topics and recent publications from relevant ML conferences and journals are selected and discussed in detail. Participants will implement prototypes of the presented algorithms and present their observations and results to the class.\n\nThe aim of the course is to build and enhance know-how on three major topics for responsible AI. A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain what AI means to discuss and identify the common assumptions we make, and the ones we should avoid when building AI responsibly,\ninvestigate, identify, and discuss issues with AI systems responsibly within and outside the community,\ngive an overview of challenges and state-of-the-art in fairness and bias when building and deploying AI,\ndiagnose bias in predictive and generative AI,\nbe familiar with common sources of bias, and mitigate bias in predictive and generative AI by either adapting the modeling or employing mitigation strategies from algorithmic fairness,\nunderstand most common types of explainable AI models, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses,\napply explainable AI models in real scenarios for predictive and generative AI, and interpret their explanations,\nreading research papers with both technical and ethical content, understanding them and presenting their content,\npresenting analysis and results in writing.",
    "Content": "The course will consist of three parts:\nThe first part of the course will be about the epistemology of machine learning, model-fitting vs. artificial intelligence, Bayesian problems, and Generative AI. Next, the fairness component will review classical algorithmic fairness methods and their limitations and potential solutions. Finally, we will learn about different paradigms of explainable AI such as saliency and prototype based methods, their use cases, as well as their validation. We will discuss and experiment the possibility of explaining generative AI. As part of this, we will study the philosophical assumptions in explainable AI and review AI ethics.",
