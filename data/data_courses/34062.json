    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims at providing knowledge and skills within contemporary photonic integrated circuit technologies including different forms of silicon photonics. The students should acquire an overview of the different integration platforms used for photonic integrated circuits and be able to select one based on a target application. The student should be able to design components and circuits using standard design tools and generate a mask set for an internal or foundry process.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the origin of losses in waveguides.\nExplain the functionality of basic waveguide components: Waveguides, MMI and Y splitters, directional couplers, arrayed waveguide gratings, microring-resonators, grating couplers and mode expanders.\nDerive the functionality of interferometers, gratings and coupled rings (S-matrix/coupled mode theory)\nCompare material platforms for non-linear integrated photonics.\nExplain the functionality of DFB lasers, Vernier tuned lasers, modulaters, tuneable mirrors and couplers.\nCalculate the performance of waveguide components using commercial software\nAnalyse a pin junction using commercial software.\nOptimize the layout of a component or circuit for a chosen figure of merit.\nAnalyse the pros and cons of different integration platforms and integration techniques for combining materials\nAnalyse the performance of a photonic integrated circuit.\nAnalyse the implications for fabrication constraints\nDesign mask layout for a component or circuit",
    "Content": "The basic photonic components used in photonic integrated circuits (PIC) like waveguides, splitters, directional couplers, resonators, wavelength-selective devices, polarization-dependent components, amplifiers, lasers, and detectors are analyzed. The main integration platforms: InP, Si, SiO2, Si3N4, GaAs, LiNbO3 and the heterogeneous integrated silicon photonics by wafer bonding and micro-transfer printing is described in detail. Also, integration by direct epitaxial growth is described. Packaging, foundry processes, fabrication imperfections, and optimization will also be covered.\nMost lectures will be based on a journal article discussing a PIC on an integration platform, go through a photonic component in detail and have 2 hour exercise using various simulation software. Mode and propagation calculation are done with the Lumerical software, semiconductor pin structures using COMSOL and mask design using python/Nazca. A large part of the second half of the course will be devoted to a large design task for a device or circuit including full 3D simulations and mask layout in a chosen platform.",
    "Course literature": "For waveguide components, we will use part of Principles of Photonic Integrated Circuits : Materials, Device Physics, Guided Wave Design, by Richard Osgood Jr. and Xiang Meng (2021) (available electronically from the DTU library). Scientific papers will be used to illustrate state of the art for the different integration platforms.",
