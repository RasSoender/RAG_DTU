    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nChemical process design is about finding a sustainable process that can convert the raw materials to the desired products cost effectively. Chemical engineers support diverse range of sectors and process industries, which convert raw materials to more than 70,000 products. Given this diverse set of industries and sectors with its own domain specific equipment and standards, in this course, the objective is to introduce students to systematic methods for process design, to give overview of the main steps involved in typical life cycle of a process design, as well as the complexity of the design activity. In addition to systematic approach for process design, we stress the importance of iterative process analysis including economics, uncertainty & sensitivity analysis of design assumptions, heat integration, optimization as well as sustainability analysis of conceptual process design. In this way, the course aims to equip students with a flexible skillset to help design innovative, cost-competitive and sustainable processes in diverse range of processing industries.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply a systematic approach for process design\nIdentify, gather and analyze necessary data, methods and models for design\nAppreciate complexity of process design & make design related decisions\nGenerate and evaluate/screen alternatives for design\nUse computer aided tools & work in groups\nVerify and analyze simulation results\nPerform process economics analysis including uncertainty analysis\nPerform heat integration and design via pinch analysis\nApply nonlinear programming for process optimization\nPerform life cycle analysis (LCA) to assess environmental aspects of sustainable process design\nUse knowledge to solve practical engineering problems\nApply chemical engineering principles learned from other courses",
    "Content": "The course consists of classroom lectures followed by group work on the project assignment.\n\nThe course lectures follow the task-based systematic design methodology, which introduces systematic methods and concepts for process design as follows:\nLecture 1: Introduction to process design\nLecture 2: Process flowsheet synthesis & verification (Douglas method)\nLecture 3: Flowsheet performance evaluation – a simple strategy\nLecture 4: Reactor Design, analysis & sizing -rigorous models\nLecture 5: Separation process design & sizing -rigorous models\nLecture 6: Sensitivity Analysis in Process Design\nLecture 7: Capital and Production Cost Estimation\nLecture 8: Economic Assessment and Uncertainty Analysis\nLecture 9: Process and Flowsheet Optimization\nLecture 10: Heat Integration and HXN design\nLecture 11: Sustainability Analysis in Process Design\n\nThe project assignment which is worked in groups of 3 members contains three parts that builds on each other:\nPart 1. Scope of Design\nImplement the conceptual process in a simulator of your choice (Aveva or excel spreadsheet). Report and discuss mass and energy calculations (Lectures 1 to 5).\nPart 2. Process economics and uncertainty analysis.\nPerform cost estimation, economics, sensitivity & uncertainty analysis, and discuss the results (Lectures 6 to 8)\nPart 3. Advanced process analysis (e.g. process optimization, heat integration, and sustainability analysis)\nPerform optimization, heat integration, and sustainability analysis, compare/benchmark other alternatives, and discuss the results. (Lectures 9 – 11).\nEach part will be followed by selected group presentations (each group will present at least one part of the assignment).",
