    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nMachine learning is fundamental to artificial intelligence because learning flexible statistical models from data has emerged as the currently best way to scale AI to near human-level performance in applications to for example images, natural language and speech. Careful modeling of all contributions to uncertainty is the key to theoretical understanding and successful applications. With more flexible models such as those used in deep learning this becomes increasingly important but also difficult. In the course, Bayesian machine learning is used as it provides a unified approach to reason about uncertainty associated with both the data and the specification of the model.\n\nThe purpose of the course is two-fold. First of all, the goal is to equip students with a deeper theoretical understanding of probabilistic machine learning and to enable them to read and understand the newest research literature in the field. Second, to enable students to discuss probabilistic models for practical problems and to discuss and apply appropriate inference algorithms.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDiscuss fundamental concepts in Bayesian machine learning: prior distributions, likelihood functions, posterior distributions and model evidence\nExplain and discuss common distributions and assumptions for probabilistic models\nDiscuss and relate maximum likelihood inference, maximum a posteriori, exact Bayesian inference, and approximate Bayesian inference\nPerform and analyse approximate inference by sampling and variational methods.\nImplement and analyse methods for model selection and evaluation\nDiscuss uncertainty quantification and calibration in Bayesian models\nExplain and apply Bayesian decision theory\nDiscuss and apply approximate Bayesian inference for deep learning models\nDesign Bayesian machine systems for supervised and unsupervised learning\nDesign and implement numerical experiments to evaluate machine learning systems.",
    "Content": "Content may vary from year to year but typically covers: 1) linear and non-linear models, 2) parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric machine learning, 3) Gaussian process 4) Mathematical modelling of pattern recognition systems, 5) approximate inference using sampling and variational methods 6) evaluation and test to provide unbiased performance measures, 7) Bayesian modeling for either audio, image or text data using deep learning structures.",
