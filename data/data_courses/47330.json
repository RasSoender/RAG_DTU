    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course will provide sustainable energy engineers with knowledge of energy storage and conversion technologies which are rapidly growing in necessity for large-scale integration of renewable energy on the system and grid level. The students will acquire an overview of the state-of-the-art ways that electrical energy and thermal energy can be stored: electrochemical storage (e.g. batteries and electrolysers), other electrical storage (e.g. compressed air and flywheels) and heat storage (e.g. by means of hot water, borehole, and phase-change materials). The students will develop an understanding of their physical and chemical principles, capabilities and limitations, materials employed, system designs and techno-economics. The students are expected to analyse the comparative advantages and applications of the technologies.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the current energy system in terms of demand by sector and how energy is supplied\nExplain the physical and chemical principles of different energy storage and conversion technologies\nDescribe the requirements of different applications for storage of heat and electricity\nCalculate the energy content and energy losses of different energy storage types\nCritically read, understand and analyse literature on energy storage to a level where its findings can be evaluated\nCompare the properties of different types of batteries and identify the most optimal battery for selected applications\nDescribe the materials employed and electrical characteristics of different electrolysis technologies\nEvaluate advantages and disadvantages of different technologies for heat storage\nEvaluate which types of storage technologies are suitable for a given application\nEstimate and calculate the costs of storing electrical and thermal energy for specific scenarios",
    "Content": "The course will explain the basic principles of electricity storage and heat storage technologies and their role in the present and future sustainable energy systems. An overview of the different storage methods will be given followed by studies of the different types in detail. Electrochemical energy storage using conventional batteries, flow batteries and electrolysers will be described in terms of thermodynamics, operating principles, efficiency, lifetime, energy density and storage duration. Other electrical storage technologies including pumped hydro, compressed air, flywheels, Carnot batteries and supercapacitors will be introduced and compared. Heat storage and different technologies for it will be worked on during the course as well. Design criteria and examples of simulations and techno-economics calculations e.g. to determine feasible storage solutions for certain applications and scenarios will be given.",
    "Course literature": "Various teaching material will be used, all available for free online for the students.",
    "Remarks": "If you wish to achieve more in-depth knowledge of electrochemical energy storage in fuels/chemicals, you can also take course 47211. Please note that course 47211 is a BSc course.",
