    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe rapid advancement and increasing variety of high-throughput genomic tools, now offer opportunities to explore and apply them in natural and farmed populations. The aim of the course is to provide an array of theoretical and practical competences on genomics and bioinformatics with focus on animal breeding, conservation and management. Through theoretical, individual and group exercises, the students will learn how to handle, analyze and interpret a selected range of high-throughput genomics data in relation with genomic improvement and selection, resource management and traceability strategies of domesticated and wild animals, particularly fish and shellfish species",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUtilize the most important international databases to retrieve information on the genomic resources available for different species.\nUtilize the Unix and R environment to handle genomic and transcriptomic data.\nApply the most updated bioinformatics tools to analyze and interpret high throughput genomic and transcriptomic data with different available genomic information.\nDescribe methods for DNA-based barcoding, including environmental DNA (eDNA)\nDescribe and apply concepts and genomic tools related with conservation and biodiversity (e.g. population-based inferences, population mixtures, genome wide differentiation and environmental DNA).\nExplain and utilize concepts and genomic tools related with genetic improvement and sustainable aquaculture production (e.g. signatures of selection, QTL, Genome Wide Association Studies, and genomic selection)\nAdopt critical approaches to evaluate and apply high-throughput genomic tools for problem-solving in practical cases of selection and conservation of animal species.\nDevelop a large-scale data project and present its results",
    "Content": "Basic principles of conservation/population genetics, biodiversity breeding and genomic selection, high-throughput sequencing and genotyping platforms. Moderate level of hands-on work with bioinformatics pipelines to analyze a variety of genome and transcriptome-based data types. Activities and discussions where the concepts and tools are put into use through confrontation with specific problems presented by teachers",
