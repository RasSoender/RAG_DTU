    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course presents thermodynamic- and kinetic principles and concepts that are commonly used in protein science. We will introduce the theoretical framework for this field, and focus particularly on practical skills for the quantitative analyses of biochemical and biophysical processes. The course will enable the student to formally describe the rates and strength of ligand binding to proteins, as well as the energetics of protein folding and –stability. Other examples include the analysis of protein aggregation and phase separation assays, the interaction of proteins with lipids and nucleic acids\nParticular emphasis will be put on the students’ ability to handle, analyse and visualize real world experimental data, to evaluate different theoretical models and to perform statistical analysis. All analysis will be done with Python.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze the rate and strength of ligand binding from data obtained with a variety of different methods.\nIdentify spontaneous and non-spontaneous biochemical processes.\nEvaluate thermodynamic and kinetic stability of protein conformations.\nAssess enthalpic- and entropic contributions to the driving force for folding and binding.\nDiscuss intermolecular forces that drive protein interactions.\nUnderstand diffusion and quantify diffusion rates.\nModel multi-step enzyme reactions and identify rate-limiting steps.\nUnderstand energy landscapes for catalysis and folding (including the effects of mutations).\nAnalyse kinetic data of protein aggregation.\nUnderstand the basics of statistical thermodynamics applied to protein folding and interactions.\nAnalysis the thermodynamics of liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins.\nPerform linear and non-linear fitting of experimental data sets.",
    "Content": "The content will cover both kinetic aspects (enzymes, aggregation) as well as thermodynamics (ligand binding, protein folding, protein-protein interactions, phase separation) of protein reactions. Some aspects, such as protein folding will be partly discussed with the help of toy models, but overall the emphasis will be on the analysis of real world data from the literature or our own research projects. The students will be equipped with a very large tool kit to quantitatively analyse basically any relevant type of interaction that proteins can undergo, both from the kinetic and thermodynamic standpoint.",
    "Course literature": "A course compendium and other relevant material will be provided on DTU Learn, which contains materials from:\n- Klostermeyer et al., Biophysical Chemistry\n- Dill et al., Molecular Driving Forces\n- Philips et al., Physical Biology of the Cell\n- Bahar et al., Protein actions – Principles and modeling\n- Barrick – Biomolecular thermodynamics\n- etc.",
