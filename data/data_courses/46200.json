    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe student is provided with an overview of the steps in planning and managing the development of a new wind farm. The student is introduced to wind resource assessment and siting, wind farm economics and support mechanisms for wind energy. An overview of the various environmental impacts and societal challenges from wind farms is offered.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the methodologies of wind resource assessment and their advantages and limitations\nExplain the steps in the selection of a site for measurement of the wind resource and good practice for measurement of the wind resource\nCalculate the annual energy production using the WAsP software for simple wind farm cases in terrain within the operational envelope of the WAsP model\nIdentify and describe factors adding to the uncertainty of the wind resource and wind farm production estimates\nEstimate the most important key economic parameters of a wind project and explain their relevance\nIdentify the main environmental impacts from a wind farm and suggest mitigation measures\nExplain the three most common policy tools for support of wind energy projects\nExplain the steps in the development of a wind farm with a balanced emphasis on the annual energy production, wind turbine loads, economics, grid connection, environmental impact and societal context of a project\nExplain the main steps in developing the grid connection of a wind farm\nCarry out a simple mapping and stakeholder analysis and suggest appropriate engagement strategies",
    "Content": "An introduction to market, policy and support mechanisms relevant to wind energy. Wind resources and wind conditions: anemometry and remote sensing; design and siting of meteorological stations; wind distributions; observed, generalised and predicted wind climates; observational and numerical wind atlases, elevation maps and land cover, roughness classes and roughness maps; wind farm wake effects, micro-scale flow modelling (WAsP), wind resource mapping; wind farm layout; wind farm annual energy production.\nThe procedure for obtaining an environmental permit for a wind farm including the various types of environmental impacts from a wind farm and how to deal with them. Public perception of wind energy and stakeholder engagement. Introduction to wind farm economics. Introduction to the technology including grid connection and floating wind. The students will work in groups of 4. The results of the group work will be documented in a report and will be presented orally by all course participants.",
    "Course literature": "Course notes and slides",
    "Remarks": "The course consists of five days with lectures and exercises, eight days of project work, one day of student presentations and a one-day study tour to a wind farm.",
