    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims towards an introduction to the fundamental properties of lasers and optical detectors. The student must be able to explain the physical principles behind laser action and to describe a number of actual laser systems. He/she will be able to solve simple problems in relation to the properties of light in optical resonators, coherent light and the interaction between light and matter. Different types of laser systems will be considered including solid-state, fiber and semiconductor lasers. The mode of operation and applications of a number of lasers is described so that the student will be able to understand and use commercial laser systems in connection with an actual problem. The students will be introduced to the characteristics and noise properties of optical detectors. Finally, examples of optical based measurement techniques will be introduced. in addition to the lectures a number of experimental exercises are given.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndesign a resonator system with special properties and relate these properties to the functionality of the system\nanalyze an optical measurement system and the used/chosen components\ndescribe the interaction between light and matter and relate this interaction to coherent amplification of electromagnetic radiation\ncalculate and predict the dynamics as well as steady state interaction between light and matter\ngeneralize and discuss amplification and steady state conditions of optical amplifiers with feedback\nanalyze laser systems and explain the mode of operation of the components used in the laser system, and predict the system performance\ncompare different lasers systems and from the knowledge of the characteristics make an argued choice of system for a given application\ndifferentiate and classify pulsed laser systems\nnoise and signal-to-noise ratio: describe the most important sources of noise in optical detection",
    "Content": "Laser beams, laser resonators, photonics, photons and atoms, laser amplifiers, laser oscillators, semiconductor optics and detectors.",
