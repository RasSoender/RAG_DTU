    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nParticipants will acquire a thorough understanding of Life cycle assessment (LCA) as a method and tool for analysing the environmental impacts of products and technical systems. They will obtain the concrete skills and master the methodologies and tools to perform an LCA and to critically analyse LCA results produced by others. They will know the most frequent uses of LCA in industry and government and be able to identify LCA main strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDemonstrate a fundamental understanding of life cycle thinking in the analysis and management of technological systems\nPlan and execute a life cycle assessment of a product or a technological system in co-operation with a company or other type of organisation, including:\nDefine a relevant functional unit for a product or a system\nEnsure equivalency of products or systems through system expansion or allocation\nModel a carbon footprint using a spreadsheet and model an inventory using a dedicated LCA tool\nPerform a life cycle impact assessment including midpoint and damage characterisation, normalisation and possibly weighting\nPerform sensitivity analysis and interpret the results of the LCA in accordance with the outcome\nIdentify the life cycle stages, processes and inventory flows that affect most category specific environmental impacts\nInterpret the LCA results of an individual product in a sustainable consumption and absolute sustainability context\nReport in accordance with the capabilities of the company partner\nInterpret and use life cycle assessments performed by others and perform a critical review of an LCA study\nExplain the most important industrial and regulatory applications of LCA and describe the tools of the Integrated Product Policy, IPP.",
    "Content": "Introduction of the life cycle concept and the history of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). Introduction to the practical applications of LCA (eco-labelling, environmental management, product development, policy development etc.) in industry and public organisations. Presentation of methodological foundation of LCA step by step from goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory, life cycle impact assessment, interpretation and sensitivity analysis. Positioning of individual products in a sustainable consumption and absolute sustainability context. Introduction of software tools supporting the practical performance of LCA. In parallel to the theoretical introduction the participants work in project teams applying the theory in practice in a life cycle assessment of a product or system, in collaboration with an external company. The course ends with the presentation of own LCA report and the critical review of the LCA report from one of the other groups.",
