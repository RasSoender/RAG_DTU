    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give participants knowledge about the design and implementation of network services using the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the concept of SDN (i.e. abstracting and centralizing the control plane)\nAnalyze the implications of shifting from traditional network architectures to software defined networks\nAssess the benefits and drawbacks of applying SDN in different areas in telecommunications (e.g. WAN, data centers etc.)\nExplain how existing network services can be created in SDN (e.g. firewalls, load balancing, mobility, etc.)\nUnderstand the SDN programming model (with respect to the ONOS SDN controller)\nEvaluate the possibility of creating novel network services using SDN and design such a service\nImplement a network service using the knowledge acquired throughout the lectures\nDocument and defend orally the project work",
    "Content": "The course aims to give an introduction into Software Defined Networking and how can it be used to improve current networks, as well as to enable students to develop network services using SDN specific tools.\nIn the first part of the course the students will be introduced to the SDN paradigm. A series of SDN-based network services, from different areas of telecommunications, is covered during the lectures (e.g. security, load balancing, wireless, routing, network virtualization, etc.). The course material draws from latest research and developments within SDN. The students will get hands-on experience with tools and programming models for SDN.\nThe second part of the course is reserved for students to design and implement a network application (service) using the tools and concepts introduced in the first part.",
    "Remarks": "The course material consists of lecture slides and selected papers. Minimal programming experience in Java is required. Participants are expected to use their own laptop in order to set up a virtualized environment and use it as working environment for the course.\n\nThis course is suitable as part of a PhD study plan.",
