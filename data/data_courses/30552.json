    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this era of climate change, accurate mapping and monitoring of changes, e.g., inland topography, sea level and ice sheets, highly rely on the global geodetic observing system (GGOS), compromising various space geodetic techniques such as GNSS and Earth Observation.\n\nThe course aims to provide a thorough overview of space-based geodetic technologies, including instrumentation, observation techniques, models, methods and monitoring systems to define and maintain the geodetic reference frames to measure precise positions and map the shape and gravity field of the Earth.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe geodetic coordinate and time systems, Kepler elements to describe satellite motion, and main types of satellite orbits: GEO, MEO, and LEO,\nCompute positions of satellites and transformations used in satellite geodesy,\nDescribe the main orbit perturbations due to gravimetric and non-gravimetric forces and characteristics of repeat and sun-synchronous orbits,\nCompute J2 pertubations,\nExplain the realization of a geodetic reference frame based on space geodetic techniques (VLBI, SLR, GNSS),\nAnalyse GNSS positions for monitoring continental drift and crustal deformations,\nImplement and apply conventional models for atmospheric effects on GNSS signals,\nAssess range precision and accuracy estimates for satellite altimetry,\nAnalyse satellite altimeter data for mapping sea level and ocean currents, land topography, and cryosphere,\nExplain the principles and mission characteristics of satellite gravimetry, and to\nCreate a model of mass changes from satellite gravity data.",
    "Content": "The course will focus on the space geodetic observations utilized for positioning and defining the basic reference frames for mapping and navigation, how to compute positions and how to obtain information about continental drift and crustal deformations.\n\nThe course will also focus on satellite altimetry and its use for mapping the topography of the Earth and monitoring changes in sea level, glaciers and ice sheets, and in-land water bodies. Finally, the course will focus on satellite gravimetry missions and on how these satellite missions are used for measuring the Earth's gravity field. Some examples of how satellite gravimetry may be used for monitoring mass movements will be explained.\n\nExercises are carried out using Matlab.",
    "Course literature": "Günter Seeber: Satellite geodesy: foundations, methods, and applications.",
    "Remarks": "This course provides students with competencies relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #13 (Climate Action), #14 (Life below water) and #15 (Life on land).\nThe course is recommended for the first semester of the master program Earth and Space Physics and Engineering and is mandatory for the program's study line 'Mapping and Navigation'.\nThe course is a prerequisite for 30554 Global navigation satellite systems.\nThe course does not deal with hardware. The course does not include data collection or fieldwork.",
