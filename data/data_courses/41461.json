    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course will provide building designers with knowledge of PV (photovoltaic) and enable them to use Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) solutions in their building design. Similarly the course will provide solar engineers with the understanding of the requirements for BIPV products seen from the buildings perspective. The participants will also acquire knowledge about aesthetic requirements and be familiar with technologies for balancing aesthetics and efficiency. The participants will also be presented with principles and safety matters for photovoltaic installations as well as being able to estimate the energy generated from a BIPV installation and how this energy impacts the energy frame for the building.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain photovoltaic conversion\nDescribe the different PV technologies\nExplain grid connection\nExplain the environmental factors influencing the power production\nDesign a PV system for a building\nExplain the aesthetic demands of BIPV\nAssess the energy production from the BIPV installation\nCalculate the energy impact on the building\nAccount for the structural demands of the building in connection with BIPV\nAssess the impact on the building envelope with BIPV\nAcount for BIPVs impact on the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) of a building",
    "Content": "The course will explain the basic principles of photovoltaic conversion and installation of photovoltaic systems. Afterwards, building material – and aesthetic requirements will be explained, and technologies to achieve good aesthetics will be presented. Principles for estimation of the generated energy will be presented, and examples of how the energy contributes to the energy frame of the building will be explained. The requirements of the building structure as a consequence of BIPV is explained. Also, the changes to the building envelope in terms of moisture properties is presented. BIPV's LCA impact on the building will be presented.",
