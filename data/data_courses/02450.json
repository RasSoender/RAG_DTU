    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the participants knowledge of\n* fundamental and widely applied methods for data modeling and machine learning,\n* a framework for data modeling,\n* Matlab, R or Python as a tool for data analysis (the participant can freely choose between these programming languages).\n\nThe course enables the participants to apply machine learning for modeling of real world data.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the major steps involved in data modeling from preparing the data, modeling the data to evaluating and disseminating the results.\nDiscuss key machine learning concepts such as feature extraction, cross-validation, generalization and over-fitting, prediction and curse of dimensionality.\nSketch how the data modeling methods work and describe their assumptions and limitations.\nMatch practical problems to standard data modeling problems such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and association mining.\nApply the data modeling framework to a broad range of application domains in medical engineering, bio-informatics, chemistry, electrical engineering and computer science.\nCompute the results of the data modeling framework by use of Matlab, R or Python.\nUse visualization techniques and statistics to evaluate model performance, identify patterns and data issues.\nCombine and modify data modeling tools in order to analyze a data set of their own and disseminate the results of the analysis.",
    "Content": "Structured data modelling. Data preprocessing. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction including principal component analysis. Similarity measures and summary statistics. Visualization and interpretation of models. Overfitting and generalization. Classification (decision trees, nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, neural networks, and ensemble methods.) Linear regression. Clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering, and mixture models.) Association rules. Density estimation and outlier detection. Applications in a broad range of engineering sciences.",
    "Course literature": "Course notes",
    "Remarks": "The course is a basic machine learning course relevant for all technical diploma, bachelor, and master programs. The course is designed as a stand-alone course and provides an introduction to basic machine learning, the mathematics behind the methods, and hands-on experience in their use.",
