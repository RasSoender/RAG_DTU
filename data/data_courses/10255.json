    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nX-ray imaging and microscopy is utilized in all aspects of life, from hospitals through basic science to industry and museums. In the past 30 years we witnessed a rapid development using both synchrotrons and lab sources for X-ray imaging with many new modalities and application areas. The variety is large, but all methods share the same underlying principles, which will be presented in detail in the course.\n\nThe course will provide student with a comprehensive view of advanced x-ray imaging methods, such as phase and diffraction contrast tomographic and emerging coherent microscopy techniques. The course aims to establish a connection between the theoretical description of image formation and the application of the methods across materials science, biology and other domains. The students will become familiar with simulations of X-ray images and movies and independently interpret complex 3D data. The know-how obtained in this course is relevant for becoming an expert in R&D in the area in academia or the rapidly growing x-ray industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the properties of coherently and incoherently formed images\nPerform simulations of partially coherent X-ray waves interacting with materials\nDerive and apply phase retrieval using established concepts\nExplain and apply Fourier optics\nExplain the mathematical principles of tomographic reconstruction\nPerform simulations with tomographic and phase reconstruction tools\nExplain the principles of diffraction contrast tomography\nPerform diffraction and phase contrast tomography experiments and data analysis\nExplain and use iterative reconstruction methods exploiting coherent fields.\nEvaluate x-ray imaging methods to identify and apply the most appropriate method or combination of methods to quantify the 3D structure of materials",
    "Content": "These will include shorter lectures, discussions of literature that the students have read, simulations and experimental demos. It will also comprise 4 homeworks, each taking nominally 6 hours.\n\nThe course introduces the student to modern concepts of imaging with X-rays emerging from advanced laboratory based sources and large scale accelerator based X-ray sources. Building upon the a priori knowledge of materials/bio-structures the student learns the concepts of diffraction contrast and near-field image formation. The mathematics of tomographic reconstruction and practical experience using available tools will be covered. The lectures will include a hands-ons simulations with the aim to establish the connection between the theory and software implementation.\n\nThe lectures and exercises will cover in particular the following topics:\n• The physics behind propagation of X-rays in media.\n• Photon-matter interactions, attenuation, scattering and diffraction in connection with imaging.\n• Image formation in an X-ray microscope.\n• Diffraction contrast imaging (grains, defects, and stress in 3D)\n• Simulations of propagation of coherent wavefronts\n• Tomographic reconstruction algorithms and their implementation\n• Hands-on sessions with simulations and 3D data reconstructions",
