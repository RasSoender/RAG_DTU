    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo learn how to assess the interaction between marine and coastal structures with seabed and coasts, including erosion issues associated with offshore and coastal structures. To select and design structures to account for these effects, including scour protection and coastal protection system.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe scour around marine structures including offshore wind turbine foundations, pipelines, etc.\ndescribe coastal protection measures and interaction with the surrounding coasts\nperform calculations of scour around pipelines and piles.\ndesign scour protection for pipelines and piles\nperform analysis of edge scour\nutilize fundamental design principles based on long term extreme wave statistics\ndesign rubble mound and vertical breakwaters\nperform analyses of coastal protection measures",
    "Content": "Scour around marine structures including offshore wind turbine foundations, pipelines etc. Full description of flow and scour processes. Design of scour protection for pipelines and monopiles. Coastal protection methods, hard as well as soft. Design of typical marine structures as rubble mound breakwaters and caisson breakwaters.",
