    "Date of examination": "No exam, Mandatory presentation of project at the last lecture. Project report must be handed in one week later.",
    "Type of assessment": "Evaluation of experiments and reports\nEvaluation based on an overall assessment of assignments and group project reports with clear indication of individual contributions. All assignments must be approved in order to pass the course.",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , external examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "02266.02809 , Programming. JavaScript is used to create interactive data visualizations. It is an advantage to also know e.g. Python.",

    "Responsible": "Jakob Eg Larsen , Lyngby Campus, Building 321, Ph. (+45) 4525 5265 , jaeg@dtu.dk",
    "Department": "01 Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall course objective is to enable students to create and evaluate interfaces and interaction with personal data on different platforms.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the concepts personal data and personal informatics\nExplain models of personal informatics systems\nExplain and apply designs of the personal data and personal informatics life cycle\nPrototype (feedback) user interfaces and data visualizations of personal data\nDesign prototype apps for personal data interaction\nEvaluate prototype apps for personal data interaction\nApply prototyping techniques\nDesign and carry out experiments with user interfaces and interaction\nApply methods for and carry out evaluation of user interfaces and interaction",
    "Content": "The course is based on theory, methods, and techniques from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Pervasive/Ubiquitous Computing, and Mobile/Wearable Computing for the purpose of prototyping, modeling, and evaluating personal data interaction. The information life cycle of data acquisition, analysis, presentation (visualization), reflection, and action is addressed.\n\nFocus is on creating personal informatics systems and interfaces enabling self-tracking and interaction with and learning from personal data. There is emphasis on data visualization in the course. This includes development of data visualization \"dashboards\".\n\nThroughout the course students work in groups on multiple exercises, assignments and a final project, which involves prototyping and evaluation of user interfaces for personal data interaction.\n\nThe course has a broad interpretation of \"mobile\", that is, any mobile form factor including smartphones, tablets, smartwatch, self-tracking and sensing devices. Prototypes are built in any practicable technical platform as the focus is on the interaction and application aspects.",
    "Course literature": "A textbook on Human Computer Interaction is used in combination with a collection of research papers.",
    "Remarks": "Groups will be formed at the first lecture. Students not present at the first lecture will not maintain their registration in the course.\nIt is assumed that students already have sufficient programming experience to develop prototype apps and data visualization on different platforms.",
