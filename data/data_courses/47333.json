    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims at providing students with a comprehensive view of how electron microscopy can be used to characterize the structure, elemental composition and morphology of materials at various length scales, ranging from micro- to sub-atomic. Historically, electron microscopy has been a fundamental tool for understanding the relationships between structure and properties in metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and the interfaces of composite materials. The quantitative information available from electron microscopy is essential for technology development in an enormous range of applications relevant to society including nanoparticles for e.g. catalysis, electrochemical technologies for energy harvesting/conversion/storage, materials for photonic and plasmonic devices, magnetic and quantum materials for computing applications and biomaterials.\n\nElectron microscopy in its various forms (SEM, TEM, STEM, Electron Diffraction), complemented by spectroscopic methods (EDS, EELS) and assisted by sample preparation techniques provides a versatile characterization platform to help solve real-world materials problems in industry and research.\n\nThis course will enable the participants to identify electron microscopy techniques appropriate for specific tasks, understand and interpret microscopy images, diffraction patterns, spectra, and other types of data that we can collect with a modern electron microscope. The course takes students from the fundamentals of electron microscopy and guides them to understanding the current state of the art. Participants will gain hands-on experience in acquiring, processing, interpreting and quantifying electron microscopy data.\n\nSEM: scanning electron microscopy, TEM: transmission electron microscopy, STEM: scanning transmission electron microscopy, EDS: energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, EELS: electron energy loss spectroscopy",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain how the various optical elements in a microscope control the electron beam properties from the gun to the specimen and to the detectors\nExplain how an image is formed in TEM, SEM and STEM. Identify different contrast mechanisms and common artifacts.\nDefine the concept of \"transfer function\" and explain its role in imaging\nExplain the physical processes behind the emission of secondary electrons, back-scattered electrons and characteristic X-rays for bulk SEM samples. Identify the main properties of each signal such as energy, intensity and emission depth\nIdentify single-scattering processes in thin TEM specimens (elastic and inelastic) that occur when electrons encounter a material, and illustrate how scattering of electrons becomes the signals we acquire and analyze\nInterpret experimental data such as diffraction patterns, spectra, images acquired in the labs using appropriate simulation and analysis software\nDifferentiate Bragg diffraction from other scattering processes, discriminate diffraction from single crystal, polycrystalline, and amorphous materials, and determine crystallographic parameters from electron diffraction data\nPerform electron imaging and diffraction experiments, quantify microstructural features, and estimate measurement accuracy\nPerform EDS measurements, measure elemental concentrations in specimens, differentiate the physical processes and estimate accuracy of EDS in the SEM and TEM\nAcquire an EELS spectrum, and extract chemical information from it by analyzing edges\nEvaluate electron microscopy techniques to identify and apply the most appropriate method or combination of methods to quantify the micro- and nano-structure and composition of materials",
    "Content": "This course introduces scanning and transmission electron microscopy as fundamental tools for investigating matter on all relevant scales from mm to sub-nm. The students will learn the operating principles of instruments and their detectors, with emphasis on how images are formed, what kind of physical information they contain, how the information is affected by instrumental imperfections, and how to retrieve and quantify the information. Topics will include:\n• Electron-optics (what the microscope does to the electron beam)\n• Electron-matter interactions, scattering theory (what the sample does to the electron beam)\n• Image formation theory (how an image is formed in the SEM and TEM)\n• Imaging methods in the TEM and STEM (bright-field, dark-field, diffraction, high-resolution, phase contrast)\n• Spectroscopic methods (EDS and EELS)\n• Sample preparation (what criteria should be met in order to have viable samples that we can study)\n• Lab exercises in small project groups\n\nThe course is based on a combination of theoretical lectures, lab exercises, numerical and image-based exercises. Knowledge from lectures is used to extract information about the structure and composition of materials and is summarized in the project report. The course provides students with the skills to analyze, explain and conclude, with respect to state-of-the-art electron microscopy techniques.",
