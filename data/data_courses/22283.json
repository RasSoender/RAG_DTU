    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of the course is to provide theoretical insight into thermodynamics and transport processes at the length scale of individual biomolecules and other macromolecules, and to experimentally apply the obtained insight on live mammalian cell cultures and biomolecular analysis systems. The aim is to give students a joint theoretical and experimental understanding of the forces and phenomena that drive molecular interactions in biological and biochemical systems and devices at the nanometer to millimeter scale.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain microscopic and macroscopic diffusion phenomena.\napply Fick’s equations and boundary conditions to solve simple diffusion problems.\ncalculate solutions to simple flow problems and interpret the results.\nperform Gibbs free energy calculations to predict reaction equilibrium constants.\nexplain the consequences of solvation for reaction equilibrium and kinetics.\nexperimentally measure and analyze binding strength and kinetic parameters.\napply a numerical simulation to predict compound transport, equilibria, and consumption.\ndescribe key mammalian cell culture processes.\nculture mammalian cells in aseptic conditions.\nanalyze the effects of stimuli on cell viability, metabolism, and proliferation.",
    "Content": "The course introduces theoretical and experimental molecular thermodynamics from a chemical, physical, and biological perspective.\n\nIn the first half, we will explore both passive and active transport mechanisms, i.e., diffusion and advection, as well as core aspects of reaction equilibrium and kinetics, including Gibbs free energy, equilibrium constants, and solvation effects. We will link these phenomena to biological and bioanalytical processes in biomolecular assays and in live mammalian cell cultures. We will further apply the combined theoretical insight to perform predictive numerical simulation of the transport, equilibrium, and consumption of compounds in a biomolecular system.\n\nIn the second part, we will apply the acquired knowledge on selected experimental systems, such as binding affinity assays, biomolecular assays, and live cell cultures. An essential aspect of this part will be experimental training in core mammalian cell culture procedures and key methods to characterize cell viability, cell metabolism, and cell proliferation.",
