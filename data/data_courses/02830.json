    "Danish title": "Avanceret projekt i digitale medieteknologier",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "10",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Design and Innovation\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E5B (Wed 13-17)\nThe course is in schedule E5B for project presentations, but individual supervision is arranged with the supervisor.",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The work involves a project which includes the development of a prototype of an app, a system, or a model. Students present their ongoing work. We emphasize discussions between students as well as between students and supervisors.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\nTwo times during the course, the groups present their status and answer questions pertaining to their project. These two presentations serve as partial exams with a weight of 1/3. In addition, the students prepare a report in the form of a journal paper. The reports are either individual or must clearly state each student's contribution. The reports have 2/3 weight for the final grade.",

    "Department": "01 Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner\n\nIt is an advantage if students beforehand have an agreement with a thesis supervisor from Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence",
    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo develop the student's abilities to carry out a large project in the area of digital media engineering / human-centered artificial intelligence. This involves a literature study, planning, implementation, testing, experiment and the writing of a report in the form of a scientific paper.\n\nThe project is considered a pre-project for a master's thesis, thus it is desirable to identify a supervisor beforehand who can also supervise the subsequent master's thesis.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze a technical problem and extract a concrete goal.\nCollect information about a problem domain.\nDescribe the most recent methods in a concrete area of digital media technologies.\nSelect suitable methods for a given problem.\nDescribe scenarios to derive requirements for a solution.\nConstruct a design based on requirements.\nPlan a project, carrying out risk analysis and time management.\nDeal with a larger amount of content and/or source code.\nCarry out a larger practical task in digital media.\nTest whether a given goal has been reached.\nPrepare a report in the form of a scientific paper.",
    "Content": "Students work in groups (one to four persons) independently on projects which they themselves help select and delimit within topics from the MSc in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (formerly Digital Media Engineering). It is a requirement that the projects lead to a clearly defined prototype.\n\nThe course aims to develop the students' methods and is based on individual supervision. The students are expected to present the status of their projects at regular intervals.\n\nRecent literature forms the basis of the work, and it is a stated goal to bring the students up to the research frontier in a specific area within digital media engineering.",
