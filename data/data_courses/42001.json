    "Danish title": "Storskala energisystemanalyse med Balmorel",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Sustainable Energy\nProgramme-specific course (MSc), Sustainable Energy Systems\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Sustainable Energy",
    "Schedule": "June\nThe course is available first time in 2023",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The course consists of lectures, exercises and a group project assignment. The students learn to develop future energy scenarios and undertake energy system analyses of these scenarios with the Balmorel tool.",
    "Duration of Course": "3 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "The last day",
    "Type of assessment": "Written examination and exercises\nThe project assignment is performed in groups with individualised contributions. The assigment and written exam contribute to an overall assessment.",
    "Exam duration": "Written exam: 2 hours",
    "Aid": "All Aid - no access to the internet",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , internal examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "42101/ 42112 , It is definitely recommended to have a basic understanding of operation research in order to get the full benefit of this course and perform well. It is also an advantage to have an understanding of energy economics e.g. through course 42015.",

    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main purpose of the course is for the students to learn how to perform analysis of future energy system scenarios.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCollect and evaluate data critically e.g. by comparing production costs of technologies\nDevelop internally consistent future energy scenarios\nRepresent energy demand, conversion and resource potentials for future energy systems\nAnalyse national energy system scenarios\nValidate and explain results\nClarify sensitivities of main assumptions through sensitivity analysis\nSynthesise the main conclusions and discuss results in relation to results of other energy system analyses and current debate in society\nChoose between different types of energy system models for different purposes\nExplain the main functionalities of the Balmorel model\nCritically reflect on tool functionalities as well as main assumptions and limitations of energy system analyses",
    "Content": "We introduce the concepts of energy system analysis and scenario building. In lectures, exercises and project work the students gradually learn how to build scenarios and analyse future large scale energy systems, as well as assess energy system analyses performed by others. The GAMS based tool, Balmorel, will be applied as an exemplary model.",
    "Course literature": "Mandatory literature:\nBalmorel manual, lecture note and videos (handed out when course begins)\nBalmorel article (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2018.01.003)",
