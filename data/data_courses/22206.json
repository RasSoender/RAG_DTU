    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce students to the experimental techniques used in healthcare engineering.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nplan and carry out a sequence of experiments with a tight time schedule.\nwork with an open problem within healthcare engineering.\nwork in the lab with safety in focus.\nparticipate constructively in a cross disciplinary research team.\nuse equipment and methods in a qualified manner and account for the operational principles.\naccount for the theoretical background behind the experiments.\nanalyse experimental data based on relevant theory.\naccount for and discuss experimental sources of error.\nwrite a brief and precise commented lab-journal that makes the results useful also to the other team members.\npresent in a brief but precise manner the experimental results at a mini conference.\ngive constructive feedback to the written and oral presentations of the other groups.",
    "Content": "The course is an experimental project, and the content of the project is strongly related to the ongoing research at DTU Health Tech. Some of the projects will give you the opportunity to work with cell culture, fluorescent microscopy, 3D printing, drug delivery formulation, biomaterial testing, biosensor testing and similar fields of research. The project can be considered as a pre-MSc project.",
    "Remarks": "Students are encouraged to find their own supervisor for the project, eg. the supervisor they want for a future MSc project.",
