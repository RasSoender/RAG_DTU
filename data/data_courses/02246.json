    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nModel checking is a set of modelling and analysis techniques combining logic, graph-based models of computation (automata, transitions systems, Markov chains,...), probabilities, statistics, constraint solving, artificial intelligence and game theory. Following this course the students will be able to apply model checking techniques for modelling, specification and validation/verification for various classes of systems (distributed/concurrent systems, schedulers, controllers, networks, biological systems, games, etc.). The students will also understand how model checking complements other formal methods techniques, and they will understand the connections to other fields such as artificial intelligence.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the characteristic features of a given system;\nexplain the basic concepts of the process oriented approach to modelling, specification and validation/verification of systems;\nexplain the covered modelling formalisms and use them to model systems;\nexplain the covered logical specification formalisms and use them to specify properties related, e.g., to safety, security and performance;\noperate state-of-the-art verification tools and explain the overall workings of such tools;\nidentify situations where the covered techniques apply;\nmotivate and design a series of experiments using verification tools and interpret the results obtained;\nachieve the above goals in a group effort while at the same time maintaining individual accountability; and\ncommunicate his/her results in a clear and precise manner using a standard form for technical reports.",
    "Content": "The course covers three main topics:\n(1) Methods for modeling systems with features such as non-determinism, probabilistic/stochastic aspects, and multiple agents/objectives: transition systems, Markov models, and games.\n(2) Logical formalisms for expressing properties related to the safety, security, and performance of systems.\n(3) Validation and verification tools that determine the relationship between models and properties in order to establish strong guarantees related to safety, security, and performance.",
    "Course literature": "Excerpts from relevant text books, e.g. Baier & Katoen: Principles of Model Checking, MIT Press.",
