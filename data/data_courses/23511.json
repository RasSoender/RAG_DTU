    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course gives the students a substantial theoretical knowledge of food technology with basis in assessing physical properties of food products including their rheology and texture. Particular emphasis is on theories and basic engineering calculations for assessing composition and processing times for central unit processes in food production, including heating and cooling of solid food, freezing, drying, membrane and separation processing technologies. More over students will be familiar with basic concepts of some novel processing techniques. Furthermore, the course gives the students sufficient knowledge about thermo-microbiology to be able to integrate this knowledge in evaluating the results of calculations of food processes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEstimate the physical properties of a foodstuff according to its composition.\nIdentify the basic heat and mass transfer mechanisms occurring during food processing.\nDescribe the physical meaning of the variables and parameters involved in a process, and predict their influence on the processing time.\nPredict processing times for heating, cooling, freezing drying, salting and membrane separation under simplified assumptions.\nAssess whether a process has reached the steady state.\nApply reaction and inactivation kinetics to predict the effect of thermal processes on product quality, safety and shelf life.\nIdentify possible problems of product safety and product quality and propose plausible solutions.\nDescribe the steady shear and viscoelastic behavior of food materials and the use of rheological parameters in food processing calculations and food product development\nDemonstrate teamwork by collaborating to research, evaluate sources, and synthesize findings to understand new technologies for food processing through the creation of a poster presentation",
    "Content": "- Calculation of composition and physical properties of foods.\n- Unsteady-state heat transfer.\n- Calculation of microbial inactivation and F-values.\n- Rheological measurements and food processing.\n- Mechanical properties of solid foods.\n- Reaction kinetics during food processing.\n- Freezing.\n- Salting.\n- Membrane separation.\n- Drying.\n-Ohmic heating\n-Group work on novel food processing technologies",
