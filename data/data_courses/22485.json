    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose of the course is to give a thorough introduction to modern diagnostic imaging systems. This includes the primary systems as X-ray, computer tomgraphy (CT), ultrasound and MR. Certain aspects of PET, PET/CT, PET/MR and SPECT will also be explained. Both the physics behind the systems will be taught as well as the signal processing performed in the systems. A number of exercises will be made. Two projects about two different imaging systems must be handed in during the course.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the physical interaction mechanisms for ultrasound, X-ray, CT, MR, SPECT, and PET scanning.\nexplain the signal processing involved in making an ultrasound image.\nexplain signal processing methods for estimating blood velocity using ultrasound.\nexplain back-projection algorithms used in CT, MR, and PET scanners.\nwrite programs in Matlab that implement signal processing methods and estimators used in medical imaging.\nwrite reports describing quantitative results from Matlab programs.\nunderstand journal articles on medical imaging and implement signal processing algorithms from the literature.\ngive a quantitative evaluation of signal and image processing algorithms in terms of performance and accuracy.\nwrite a scientific report explaining a signal processing algorithm implementation made in Matlab and quantifying its performance.\nidentify anatomic structures in a clinical image.",
