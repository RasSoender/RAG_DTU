    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to introduce the fundamental concepts, methods, and challenges of engineering distributed real-time systems. Students will learn about real-time task models, schedulability analysis, and real-time networks, with a focus on Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). Through exercises and a project, students will simulate scheduling or traffic shaping policies and optimize system architecture or design, such as task mapping to cores or routing of messages. Self-learning components include simulation and metaheuristic optimization methods for exercises and project work.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the key principles and definitions of distributed real-time systems engineering\nUnderstand the concepts and operations of real-time task models and schedulability analysis\nApply techniques for real-time network analysis, focusing on Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)\nAnalyze scheduling algorithms and traffic shaping policies for real-time systems\nEvaluate different strategies for system optimization, including task mapping to cores and routing of messages\nCreate simulations to test scheduling or traffic shaping policies in distributed real-time systems\nApply metaheuristic optimization methods to solve complex system optimization problems\nDesign distributed real-time system architectures that meet specified requirements\nCritique and optimize distributed real-time systems based on performance metrics\nCommunicate complex system designs and optimizations effectively in both written and oral forms",
    "Content": "The course is structured into three main sections: (1) Introduction to real-time systems, focusing on the periodic task model and schedulability analysis. (2) Detailed exploration of real-time networks, especially Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), and their importance in distributed systems. (3) Application of knowledge through exercises and a project on system simulation, scheduling policies, traffic shaping, and system optimization, including task mapping and message routing. Metaheuristics as an optimization method will be introduced for system optimization challenges.",
