    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo create a learning environment where students work in mixed disciplinary teams to turn technology or market opportunity/need into a product/service and a new business venture. Unlike usual product development or entrepreneurship courses, we have a focus on business to business (B2B), taking students out of their comfort zones, pushing them behind the scenes of unfamiliar technologies and business sectors.\n\nThe course is set in an incubator format and emphasizes a learning by doing philosophy. To speed up the learning process, we bring in some of the country’s top X-Tech Entrepreneurs, most of them founders and CEOs. Each of the keynotes will help to emphasis the importance of the methods and theory being taught in the course.\n\nThe overall course objective is to create a technology demonstrator and a business plan that will be pitched to the examiners (and investors) – with the aim to raise investment and to spinout.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDesign a product or service in a interdisciplinary collaboration with students with various engineering backgrounds (eg. Physics, Electronics, Computer Science, Nano-tech, Mechanical Design, Photonics, Food, Management etc.).\nDevelop a product or service where the project submitter is not your employer, but instead a customer or stakeholder to your own business.\nApply the principles of effectuation in the development of the given joint-venture project.\nAsses the technological risk involved in commercializing X-Tech.\nForecast business potential in the form of market value and projected gross revenue.\nDevelop and test pretotypes and prototypes.\nDesign a fitting Minimal Viable Business Product (MVBP) for the project.\nKnowledge of Intellectual Property Rights, and understanding of how these can hinder or offer opportunities to the joint-venture project.\nCreate a business plan and make an investment pitch.\nEvaluate your business from a sustainability and SDG point of view",
    "Content": "The course covers all of the topics contained within a modern investor pitch deck and business plan. X-Tech cover topics related to technology risk mitigation, product/service-systems, pretotyping and MVPs, IPR, financing, value propositions, business modelling, segmentation & market estimation as well as sustainability and the use of SDGs in a startup business model.\n\nEvery team will be joined by a business mentor who will help progress from technology to business.\n\nThe cases/projects fall into different thematic tracks suitable for all different study lines across DTU.\n\nThe final deliverable of the course is the business pitch deck and business plan. The course ends with X-Tech Finals where the students make a 4 minute business pitch plus 2 minute tech demo (total time: 6 minutes) in front of your examiners, investors and an audience.\n\nThere is prototype fund available for each team.
