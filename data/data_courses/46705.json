    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner\n\nPassed students are able to undertake more specialized studies or undertake a career in the power industry.",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give the students the necessary background knowledge of the general methods used in static power grid analysis including power flow and fault analysis. The students obtain the ability to model and solve the basic operational issues and analyze a power system under faulty conditions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDevelop and implement power flow algorithm on a computer and interpret power flow results.\nDescribe the basic principle of power system security analysis.\nDesign and implement steady state contingency analysis.\nUnderstand balanced and unbalanced fault types.\nCalculate short-circuit currents of symmetrical faults in small grids.\nUnderstand symmetrical component transformation and determine sequence networks of loads, series impedances, transmission lines, rotating machines, and transformers.\nApply symmetrical components and sequence networks in small grids and analyze unsymmetrical (single line-to-ground, line-to-line and double line-to-ground) faults.\nCalculate symmetrical or unsymmetrical fault currents in large grids using sequence bus impedance matrices.\nDescribe the basic principles of distance relays, design their zones of protection in a distance protection scheme and determine the operating time for a given fault current from provided relay characteristics.",
    "Content": "To meet the learning objectives, the learning activities are divided into the following three modules:\n\n1. Grid analysis and security assessment.\nThis module contains lectures that cover an introduction to power flow analysis and how it can be implemented in a Python program, and an introduction to power system security assessment. The lectures provide the background theory and methods that students need to implement and apply in the first hand-in assignment, with the focus on load flow and contingency analysis.\n\n2. Symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault analysis.\nThis module contains lectures that introduce fault analysis including symmetrical component transformation and its application to unsymmetrical fault analysis. The lectures provide the background theory and methods that students need to apply and implement in their second hand-in assignment. Part A of this assignment focusses on “hand calculations” for small grids; Part B extends the Python program developed in Module 1, to perform fault analysis for larger grids.\n\n3. Result verification in PowerFactory\nThis module introduces Python as a tool to automate calculations and processes in commercially available software, using PowerFactory as an example. In the final project, students utilize the built-in functionalities available in PowerFactory to control system parameters and execute software functions through the Python interface. Within this project, students conduct load flow analysis, security assessment, and fault calculation in PowerFactory, and compare the results of the commercial software with those obtained from the Python program developed in previous modules. Students are expected to identify and explain potential differences between the outcomes produced by the two programs.\n\nThe students will use Python for solving the hand-in assignments and therefore an introduction to Python will be arranged for the students at the beginning of the course.",
