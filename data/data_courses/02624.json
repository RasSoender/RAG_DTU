    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give a systematic, mathematical introduction to inverse problems in science and engineering. Such problems arise, e.g., in connection with medical imaging, tomography, seismic exploration, and deblurring og images. The course gives the mathematical background for inverse problems and their solution. The theory is illustrated by computational exercises that gives hands-on experience with some common techniques and paradigms.",
