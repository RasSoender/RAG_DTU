    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course, formerly called Modern Photonics, is about the way light interacts with solids. The aim is to give you a broad and up-to-date perspective on the optics of solids, and to introduce you to exciting present-day research and engineering topics in optoelectronics, using the 2010 edition of a well-written book. Fundamental principles of absorption, reflection, luminescence and light scattering will be discussed for a wide range of materials, including crystalline insulators and semiconductors, glasses, metals and molecular materials including graphene. Different optical properties of bulk and nanometer-sized structures are introduced. Classical and quantum models are used where appropriate, and theory goes hand in hand with discussions of experiments and modern applications. Among the topics introduced are quantum wells and dots, nanoplasmonics and metamaterials, and color centers.\n\nFurthermore, this course gives a good background (but is not a prerequisite) for Nanophotonics and Quantum Optics, and is completed by the course Applied Photonics that focuses on lasers and optical detectors.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDerive the Kramers-Kronig relations for linear dielectric response\nInterpret band structure diagrams of semiconductors and relate them to optical properties\nExplain the concept of an exciton, the difference between Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons, and give examples\nDescribe different types of luminescence and explain the basics of LEDs and diode lasers\nExplain what is quantum confinement, and explain the differences in optical properties of structures confined in 1D, 2D and 3D. Discuss applications of quantum wells and dots\nAnalyze how well the Drude model describes the measured reflectivity of a metal, explain limitations of the model. Describe the properties of surface plasmon polaritons\nDescribe the electronic properties of molecular materials and graphene and derive their optical properties. Identify the differences between graphene and conventional 2D semiconductors\nExplain what is a luminescence center, describe several types, give examples of their occurrence in nature and their use in optoelectronic devices\nExplain how infrared spectra are influenced by phonons, and discuss Brillouin and Raman light scattering\nCalculate and solve exercises directly related to the presented optical theory of solids, thereby showing feeling for the typical length, frequency and time scales involved\nWork actively in small groups, prepare a presentation about a core element of the course, and evaluate the presentations by your peers",
