    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nQuantum computer algorithms require a new mind set departing from classical computing. In this course, fundamental concepts for quantum algorithms will be introduced. The relationship between classical algorithms and quantum algorithms is studied.\n\nA wide variety of data analysis and machine learning methods are operated by performing matrix operations on vectors in a high-dimensional vector space, which is the mathematical foundation of quantum computation. This course explores how quantum machine learning can be developed.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain how superposition and entanglement can be used constructively when designing quantum algorithms\nexplain common quantum algorithms\nexplain algorithms within quantum variational methods, variational quantum eigen solvers and quantum approximate optimization\nuse quantum computing frameworks\ndevelop quantum algorithms\nevaluate the performance of quantum algorithms\noptimize a quantum algorithm for a specific platform\nrelate a quantum algorithm to complexity classes",
