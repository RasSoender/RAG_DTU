    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall aim of the course is to:\nGet a quantitative understanding of important physical,chemical and microbiological processes that control:\n- Concentrations of compounds in the environment\n- Concentrations of compounds in environmental engineering reactors/technical installations\nCreate the foundation for more advanced courses within water technology and water pollution",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCalculate concentrations in chemical equilibrium systems with acids and bases, chemical precipitation and complex formation reactions\nCarry out equilibrium calculations in two-phase gas/liquid systems\nCalculate concentrations in systems with sorption and ion exchange\nExplain the content of specifications of water quality and be able to describe the concentrations of important components in water\nSet up mass balances for natural and technical systems and be able to calculate characteristic times\nConduct calculations - based on mass balances - of transport of water components controlled by advection, diffusion and dispersion, including the transport in porous media\nInterpretation of tracer experiments as a mean for characterizing the hydraulics of environmental systems\nCarry out calculations of reaction kinetics in simple batch reactors\nCalculate concentrations in reactors combining reaction kinetics and mass transport (reactor hydraulics)",
    "Content": "Mass balances,chemical equilibria,acids and bases, carbonate chemistry, chemical precipitation, complex formation,phase distributions in two- and three-phase systems (water, solid gas),redox systems,ion exchange,sorption. Flow in porous systems. Soil properties.",
    "Course literature": "The textbook for the course is \"Environmental Engineering Science\" of WW Nazaroff and A Alvarez-Cohen, which can be purchased at the DTU book store. Additional teaching materials (lecture materials, assignments, practice presentations, additional compendia etc.) will be available at DTU Learn.",
    "Remarks": "The course or 12102 is a prerequisite for the majority of the courses in the MSc Environmental Engineering.",
