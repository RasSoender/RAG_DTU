    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students a basic knowledge about the (micro)structure and properties of concrete, so that they obtain a sufficient background to\n- estimate simple relationships between concrete structure, materials, execution, and environmental exposure\n- select materials for typical concrete structures in consideration of sustainability as well as structural detailing, execution methods, and environmental exposure.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExamine the effect of concrete composition on the workability and evaluate possible means to vary the workability\nCompare important raw materials for production of concrete and their properties\nExamine the property development as a function of time and temperature\nCalculate the volume of solids and porosity within the Portland cement-water system during cement hydration\nJudge relevant properties of cement paste from the chemical composition of the cement\nExamine relevant transport mechanisms and estimate transport of matter in concrete\nJudge typical deterioration mechanisms, typical damage types and propose means of mitigation\nRelate typical mechanical and moisture dependent properties of hardened concrete.\nSketch the fundamental developments within cement and concrete technology",
    "Content": "As far as practically possible the course is based on materials science concepts, so that the students obtain a fundamental understanding of the relationships between structure and properties of concrete. Problems of practical use for civil engineers: Selection of constituent materials, including properties of cement. Flow properties. Execution, including production and curing. Development of properties as a function of time and temperature. Mechanical properties. Durability.",
    "Remarks": "Course 12612 is based on that the students have obtained knowledge equivalent to the curriculum of course 11562/12603 (Materials Science for Civil Engineers) prior to the course. Hence, it is in course 12612 taken for granted that the students know about chemical reactions and equilibrium of reactions, thermodynamic state parameters, and thermal properties of materials.",
