    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe goal is to provide insight into the physics of atmospheric plasmas. The focus will be on electric discharge plasmas and associated phenomena. The student will acquire basic knowledge of the microphysics of discharges, the inception and properties of discharges in various gas mixtures, transient luminous events (TLEs) and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The acquired knowledge forms the foundation for further studies of electric discharges, both theoretically and through space data.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndefine the steps in discharge evolution\nclassify the relation between streamers, leaders, transient luminous events and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes\nexplain and calculate the electron motion in various gas mixtures\ncalculate collision probabilities of particles moving in an ambient gas\nplan and design simulations of particle swarms in an ambient gas\nanalyze and interpret space-data with respect to discharge properties\nuse and exploit well-known theoretical and empirical models for the atmospheric plasmas.\nexplain the structure of the atmosphere",
    "Content": "Particle motion in collision-dominated plasmas; structure of the atmosphere; streamers; leaders; transient luminous events; terrestrial gamma-ray flashes; simulations; data analysis; various gas mixtures.",
    "Course literature": "Notes will be handed out during the course.",
    "Remarks": "This course provides students with competencies relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #13 (Climate Action).",
