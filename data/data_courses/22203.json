    "course title": "22203 Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate a Healthcare Product",
    "Danish title": "Udvikle, designe, implementere og betjene et sundhedsprodukt",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "10",
    "Course type": "MSc\nGeneral competence course (MSc), Biomaterial Engineering for Medicine\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Biomaterial Engineering for Medicine\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Engineering Physics",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E3B (Fri 13-17) and January",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The teaching is based on the Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate approach. During the 13 weeks course, the teaching is a mixture of lectures, assignments and group work which facilitate the creative process of conceiving and designing a health care product. During the 3-weeks period, we go into the lab to implement the ideas. The three study lines have individual tracks in the course but excellence can only be achieved by collaborations between the different tracks.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks + 3 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E3B, The last day",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\nThe examination is based on an oral examination (counts approx. 30% in the final grade) and hand-ins (count approx. 70% in the final grade). Hand-ins include project proposal, lab book, presentations that describe management of the project, and conclude results and discussions. It is required that both hand-ins and the oral examination are passed separately. The final grade is based on an overall assessment of both part exams.",
    "Exam duration": "10 minutes (oral presentation)",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main objective of the course is to provide students with the necessary tools used in innovation processes. The key to achieve this is team work and cooperation between teams. During the course, the students will gain deep working knowledge and conceptual understanding of various health technologies (drug delivery particles, biosensing and cell models) by learning technical fundamentals. They will also learn to create and operate new healthcare products, processes and systems. Moreover, it is our aim that the students understand the importance and the strategic impact of research and technological development on society.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the fundamental principles and technologies of diagnostic devices, medicines, procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives.\ndescribe the state-of-the-art of healthcare products, and identify the current challenges.\nformulate new ideas to improve diagnostic and therapeutic options.\ndesign innovative healthcare products.\nbuild product prototypes and demonstrate the performance.\nchoose and apply statistical tests and data analysis.\nperform literature search and present the findings constructively.\ninitiate, plan a project, and write a project proposal.",
    "Content": "The course covers a range of subjects necessary for successful conception, design, implementation and operation of healthcare products. The students will acquire fundamental insights into: (1) Disease diagnostics, modeling and therapy; (2) The state of the art of healthcare products; (3) Procedures to conceive and design an innovative healthcare product, including idea formulation, methodologies, project planning and risk assessment; (4) Implementation of the project, i.e., constructing the product, building prototype and demonstrating the functionalities; (5) Analytical statistics involving how to handle, calculate and understand the obtained data and results. We will work to target cells with a nanoparticle (drug delivery), visualize the nanoparticle (biosensing) and validate the drug targeting binding and biocompatibility through 3D cell culturing. We expect that students work in a group addressing all three fields with students for each field.",
