    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo explain the background for stresses resulting from large elastic (reversible) deformations as well as plastic (irreversible) material behaviour, including creep at high temperatures. To give insight and to practice the application of models for the strength of materials, for elastic and plastic deformations. This includes models for non-linear elasticity as well as isotropic and anisotropic plasticity. To determine deformation mechanisms, which are relevant for the strength of materials and structures.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUse incremental theories for determining plastic deformations.\nCalculate plastic deformations for isotropic and kinematic hardening.\nCalculate anisotropic plastic deformations.\nAnalyse viscous effects for time-dependent deformations.\nAnalyse creep in metals.\nCalculate limit loads of beams and plates based on extremum principles.\nCharacterize large deformations.\nPerform incremental numerical analyses.\nCharacterize stresses for large deformations.\nAnalyse large elastic deformations by means of hyper-elasticity models.",
    "Content": "Large deformations. Non-linear elasticity theory. Deformation and incremental theories for elastic-plastic materials. Convexity and normality. Equilibrium equations and extremum principles. Viscoplasticity with dependence of plastic deformation on strain rates and high temperature creep. Modern numerical methods.",
