    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give an in-depth understanding of modern scientific instrumentation for X- and Gamma-Ray Astronomy. This will include both the telescopes and the detector side.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nlist the main steps in the evolution of astronomical observations\nlist the different methodologies of astronomical observations at different wavelengthsølgelængder\nlist other detection methods to e.g. gravitational waves\ndescribe X-ray telescope designs and calculate the effective area and sensitivity of an X-ray telescope\nexplain the basic interaction between X-rays and matter\nexplain the parameters entering the figure of merit of an X-ray telescope and, based on this design, optimum reflective multilayer structures\nexplain the theory behind X-ray reflection in mirrors for X-ray telescopes and use this theory to calculate reflectance from multilayer structures\nexplain the different theories for the scattering of X-rays in surfaces and use these to calculate the scattering from simple surfaces\nexplain all the elements affecting the performance of an X-ray telescope\nexplain the principle and method of magnetron sputter deposition\nuse in-house 8 keV X-ray reflectometer for characterization of mirror coating performance\napply mathematical methods to data fitting and analysis, and simulate the performance of an X-ray telescope mirror.",
    "Content": "The course will start with a short introduction to telescopes in general, followed by an introduction to astronomical observations at different wavelengths, further focusing on high-energy telescopes. A theoretical introduction to X-ray telescopes covering reflection and scattering from mirrored surfaces and laboratory exercises on the production and characterization of X-ray mirrors. The course will also include the application of analytical and numerical methods used for data analysis and simulation of the scientific capabilities of realistic astronomical instruments.",
    "Course literature": "Selected chapters from 'Modern X-ray Physics' by Des McMorrow and J. A. Nielsen.\nLecture notes and selected articles.",
