    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give a thorough introduction to time series analysis with a focus on applications relevant to engineering science and for modelling of physical systems. A special attention is put on methods for model formulation and estimation. A main goal is to form the theoretical background for applications within forecasting, automatic and adaptive control, image analysis, econometrics and technometrics.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply methods for building stochastic dynamic models\nUnderstand the relation between dynamic systems and stochastic processes\nKnowlegde about linear stochastics process models (ARMA; ARX; Box-Jenkins; GLM; OE; ARIMA; Seasonal models; etc.)\nApply and calculate correlation functions\nApply time domain and frequency domain descriptions\nPredictions in time series\nFormulate state space descriptions\nUnderstand and implement the Kalman filter\nApply regression based methods for time series\nOptimize prediction functions and model based control\nDocument and present results in a written report\nGive constructive feedback to others reports",
    "Content": "Linear stochastic processes. Conditional expectations with applications. Characterisation of stochastic processes. Second order analysis. Description in time and frequency domain. Correlation functions and their applications. Model formulation. Non-stationary processes. Time series with periodic variations and trends. Identification, estimation and verification of models for stochastic processes. Box-Jenkins method. Spectral analysis. Bivariate and multivariate time series analysis. Transfer functions with stochastic models. State space formulation, prediction and reconstruction. Kalman filter. Time series with missing observations. Methods for recursive estimation. Adaption methods. Introduction to non-linear stochastic processes.\nA number of examples of real life applications will be used for illustrating the methods. Likewise some of the assignments will be focused on application areas, e.g. development of medicine or modelling of sewage systems.",
