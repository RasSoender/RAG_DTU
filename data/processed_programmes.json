from another university or institution of higher education in denmark or abroad the student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme s maximum allowed ects credits if the student plans with odd credits in relation to dtu s credit structure of 2½ 5 and 10 ects the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works this can be done for example by using euroteq courses or project courses if the pre approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester the student must submit a new application for a pre approval of credit transfer each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university a new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions by applying students consent to dtu requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students can not procure the

further rules regarding final projects beng project bsc project and master s thesis including the possibility of preparing the project abroad are stated in the programme specifications for the said programme msc students passed msc courses at their bachelor s programme on student dtu dk under study rules teaching course registration you can read about the situation where a master s student on his her bsc or beng programme has passed a course that is a general competence course or a technological specialization course in his her master s programme and which course the student should choose instead courses taken as single subjects the student should be aware that courses taken as single subjects while enrolled in a regular full time programme at dtu can not be credited toward this full

from another university or institution of higher education in denmark or abroad the student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme s maximum allowed ects credits if the student plans with odd credits in relation to dtu s credit structure of 2½ 5 and 10 ects the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works this can be done for example by using euroteq courses or project courses if the pre approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester the student must submit a new application for a pre approval of credit transfer each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university a new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions by applying students consent to dtu requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students can not procure the

withdrawn from their study programme themselves or dtu has withdrawn them can be readmitted to the same study programme five months after their enrollment at dtu was terminated in relation to the summer admission that means an applicant must be unsubscribed by 1 april to be able to be readmitted for the semester start 1 september if the applicant is applying for readmission and already has a completed master s degree they will be subject to the master s rule which means that they can only be admitted if there are available seats in the programme applicants who are in conflict with dtu s study rules applicants who have been disenrolled from their study programme by dtu because of a violation of dtu s rules the first year exam used up exam attempts or maximum duration of the study etc or who are in violation of those rules at the time of application for readmission will need to apply for an exemption such an application is only to be submitted once dtu has notified the applicant that they must apply for an exemption please note that an exemption must be applied for regardless of whether the student is applying for a place on a different study programme than the one in which the student was previously enrolled in connection with the application for exemption dtu assesses whether the applicant s opportunities to complete the education have significantly improved since they were last enrolled at dtu this assessment can i a include academic and health conditions the applicant must thus not apply for an exemption for the rule with which they were in conflict instead they should focus on why the opportunities to complete the study programme have been improved if the application for an exemption is accepted it will be assessed whether the applicant can be readmitted if it can not be accepted the student ’ s application for readmission will be rejected read more about exemption from dtu s rules at student dtu dk under study rules exemption limitation period for

from another university or institution of higher education in denmark or abroad the student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme s maximum allowed ects credits if the student plans with odd credits in relation to dtu s credit structure of 2½ 5 and 10 ects the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works this can be done for example by using euroteq courses or project courses if the pre approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester the student must submit a new application for a pre approval of credit transfer each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university a new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions by applying students consent to dtu requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students can not procure the

further rules regarding final projects beng project bsc project and master s thesis including the possibility of preparing the project abroad are stated in the programme specifications for the said programme msc students passed msc courses at their bachelor s programme on student dtu dk under study rules teaching course registration you can read about the situation where a master s student on his her bsc or beng programme has passed a course that is a general competence course or a technological specialization course in his her master s programme and which course the student should choose instead courses taken as single subjects the student should be aware that courses taken as single subjects while enrolled in a regular full time programme at dtu can not be credited toward this full time programme at a later time pre approval of credit transfer before taking a course or going abroad students are obliged to apply for pre approval of credit transfer for planned programme elements from another university or institution of higher education in denmark or abroad the student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme s maximum allowed ects credits if the student plans with odd credits in relation to dtu s credit structure of 2½ 5 and 10 ects the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works this can be done for example by using euroteq courses or project courses if the pre approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester the student must submit a new application for a pre approval of credit transfer each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university a new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions by applying students consent to dtu requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students can not procure the documentation themselves the pre approval of credit transfer is registered in the study administration system but will not appear in the study planner until the student has passed the courses and applied for final credit it is impossible to pre approve more ects credits than there is room for in the student s study programme framework final credit transfer the student must apply for final credit for all passed courses and ects credits it is a requirement that all passed ects credits must be credited the student can therefore not choose to only apply for credit transfer for some of the passed courses or ects points once a course has been passed final credit must be sought and the credit is binding to the student and can not be withdrawn however according to dtu s specific assessment fewer ects may be transferred if this is necessary for the study plan to fit the limit of ects credits in the study programme programme elements that have been credit transferred will be recorded on the student s dtu diploma with the grade passed that applies to pre commencement credit transfers and credit transfers during the study programme however if a programme element from another danish

that they must apply for an exemption please note that an exemption must be applied for regardless of whether the student is applying for a place on a different study programme than the one in which the student was previously enrolled in connection with the application for exemption dtu assesses whether the applicant s opportunities to complete the education have significantly improved since they were last enrolled at dtu this assessment can i a include academic and health conditions the applicant must thus not apply for an exemption for the rule with which they were in conflict instead they should focus on why the opportunities to complete the study programme have been improved if the application for an exemption is accepted it will be assessed whether the applicant can be readmitted if

engineering course category 15 ects credits on the bsc programme 10 ects credits on the msc programme language and culture courses language and culture courses can not be transferred to the programme neither in connection with pre commencement credit transfer final projects a final project from another danish or foreign educational institution can not be transferred to a study programme at dtu further rules regarding final projects beng project bsc project and master s thesis including the possibility of preparing the project abroad are stated in the programme specifications for the said programme msc students passed msc courses at their bachelor s programme on student dtu dk under study rules teaching course registration you can read about the situation where a master s student on his her bsc or beng programme has passed a course that is a general competence course or a technological specialization course in his her master s programme and which course the student should choose instead courses taken as single subjects the student should be aware that courses taken as single subjects while enrolled in a regular full time programme at dtu can not be credited toward this full time programme at a later time pre approval of credit transfer before taking a course or going abroad students are obliged to apply for pre approval of credit transfer for planned programme elements from another university or institution of higher education in denmark or abroad the student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme s maximum allowed ects credits if the student plans with odd credits in relation to dtu s credit structure of 2½ 5 and 10 ects the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works this can be done for example by using euroteq courses or project courses if the pre approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester the student must submit a new application for a pre approval of credit transfer each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university a new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions by applying students consent to dtu requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students can not procure the documentation themselves the pre approval of credit transfer is registered in the study administration system but will not appear in the study planner until the student has passed the courses and applied for final credit it is impossible to pre approve more ects credits than there is room for in the student s study programme framework final credit transfer the student must apply for final credit for all passed courses and ects credits it is a requirement that all passed ects credits must be credited the student can therefore not choose to only apply for credit transfer for some of the passed courses or ects points once a course has been passed final credit must be sought and the credit is binding to the student and can not be withdrawn however according to dtu s specific assessment fewer ects may be transferred if this is necessary for the study plan to fit the limit of ects credits in the study programme programme elements that have been credit transferred will be recorded on the student s dtu diploma with the grade passed that applies to pre commencement credit transfers and credit transfers during the study programme however if a programme element from another danish educational institution assessed on the 7 point grading scale is credited as equivalent to a specific dtu course the grade from that institution will be recorded with their application the student

from another university or institution of higher education in denmark or abroad the student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme s maximum allowed ects credits if the student plans with odd credits in relation to dtu s credit structure of 2½ 5 and 10 ects the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works this can be done for example by using euroteq courses or project courses if the pre approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester the student must submit a new application for a pre approval of credit transfer each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university a new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions by applying students consent to dtu requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students can not procure the

his her bsc or beng programme has passed a course that is a general competence course or a technological specialization course in his her master s programme and which course the student should choose instead courses taken as single subjects the student should be aware that courses taken as single subjects while enrolled in a regular full time programme at dtu can not be credited toward this full time programme at a later time pre approval of credit transfer before taking a course or going abroad students are obliged to apply for pre approval of credit transfer for planned programme elements from another university or institution of higher education in denmark or abroad the student is responsible for ensuring that the desired courses can be included in the programme s maximum allowed ects credits if the student plans with odd credits in relation to dtu s credit structure of 2½ 5 and 10 ects the student must make sure to plan with other courses so that the plan works this can be done for example by using euroteq courses or project courses if the pre approved courses that the student is taking at the host university change during the semester the student must submit a new application for a pre approval of credit transfer each application must include a complete list of courses taken at the host university a new decision for the same period and the same host university will replace former decisions by applying students consent to dtu requesting the necessary information from the host institution regarding the application if the students can not procure the documentation themselves the pre approval of credit transfer is registered in the study administration system but will not appear in the study planner until the student has passed the courses and applied for final credit it is impossible to pre approve more ects credits than there is room for in the student s study programme framework final credit transfer the student must apply for final credit for all passed courses and ects credits it is a requirement that all passed ects credits must be credited the student can therefore not choose to only apply for credit transfer for some of the passed courses or ects points once a course has been passed final credit must be sought and the credit is binding to the student and can not be withdrawn however according to dtu s specific assessment fewer ects may be transferred if this is necessary for the study plan to fit the limit of ects credits in the study programme programme elements that have been credit transferred will be recorded on the student s dtu diploma with the grade passed that applies to pre commencement credit transfers and credit transfers during the study programme however if a programme element from another danish
