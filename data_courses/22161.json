    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe student will be able to solve minor life science problems in a structured manner using Python. It is an important goal for the student to acquire competences in programmatic thinking.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nunderstand the basic philosophy behind programming and apply it when considering possibilities in the language and in structuring code.\nanalyze a simple (programming) problem and ascertain its components.\ndesign the structure of a program.\nimplement a worked out design.\nanalyze a program and based on its behavior, locate and eradicate errors.\ndemonstrate and explain basic python syntax, basic data structures and 30-40 Python methods/functions.\nrecognize patterns in data files for the purpose of extracting information.\nunderstand the purpose and value of comments in the program, and apply (write) them in all code.\nadhere to basic principles in good programming practice, like evaluating the appropriateness of variable/object names and avoiding obfuscating code.\nexplain how some common life science concepts and methods translate into programming.\nbe familiar with and able to parse common file formats used in life science.\nimplement some common algorithms used in life science.",
    "Content": "This course provides an introduction to programming in life science using the Python language following basic programming principles and good programming practices. Various looping and control structures, built-in data and container types (lists and dictionaries) and basic pattern recognition are covered. As an example, common file formats in life science are parsed and manipulated. A large part of the course is spent on peer-evaluated exercises which are integrated with the lectures.",
