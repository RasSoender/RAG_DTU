    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of the course is to introduce various types of organic materials used in energy conversion and storage. Organic energy materials (OEMs) are a potentially inexpensive and sustainable alternative to their traditional counterparts that incorporate various metals. Through a combination of lectures with experimental and computational exercises, the students will learn about different types of electro- and photoactive OEMs and their applications in technologies such as solar cells, batteries, electrocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis. They will learn basic synthetic techniques to make such materials, electrochemical and spectroscopic methods to characterize them, and molecular modelling methods to calculate their properties. Finally, the students will be aware of the relative advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art OEMs as well as current challenges in their development and applications.",
