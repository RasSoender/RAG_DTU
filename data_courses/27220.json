    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to provide the students with competences in areas where bacteria are used in biotechnology. These competences will enable the students to describe the breath of biotechnology applications that are based on bacterial systems, to explain the recent technological advances in molecular and synthetic biology within the field, and to design, control and optimize bacterial cell factories, probiotic strains, and microbial communities.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the use of bacterial systems for production of chemicals, drugs, enzymes and polymers.\nDescribe the use of probiotics and biocontrol strains for microbiome engineering and disease prevention in human, aqua cultural, and agricultural systems.\nCritically assess how biotechnologically relevant pathways, bacterial strains, or communities can be identified in natural environments and used in biotech applications.\nEvaluate applications of synthetic biology methods in the development and new bacterial strains or communities.\nEvaluate genetic, evolutionary, and synthetic biology methods for optimizing phenotypes of bacterial cell factories, biofilms and bacterial communities.\nIdentify approaches to improve strain performance independently of genetic modification.\nAnalyze, interpret and evaluate experimental results from primary literature in the area of bacterial biotechnology.\nDesign strategies for development, control or optimization of bacterial cell or systems in connection to biotech applications (e.g. cell factories, probiotic strains, synthetic bacterial communities).",
    "Content": "The course is structured to provide the students with an overview of the many different beneficial uses of bacteria and the molecular and physiological mechanisms that underlies these applications. The course is focused both on novel break-through technologies in molecular and synthetic biology, and on methods to utilize the bacterial biodiversity found in nature. Overall, the course will provide the students with competences that allow them to design, develop, and improve bacterial systems for biotechnological applications.",
