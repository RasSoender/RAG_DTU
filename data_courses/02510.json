    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nYou will get practical experience in using deep learning to analyze 3D images. The main focus is on image segmentation, but you will also learn about other methods such as image classification and detection. 3D imaging is used in medicine, biology, materials research, etc. to analyze a material's internal structure including its shape, size, number of features, etc.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nselect and deploy appropriate deep learning-based methods for image segmentation, classification, and detection problems,\nselect and deploy appropriate tools for inspecting and interpreting the deep learning progress and results,\norganize data for deep learning to consider training, validation, testing, and balancing data,\nselect and use tools for efficient data labeling,\nplan image analysis pipeline including problem description, initial investigation, and deploying deep learning methods,\nplan 3D imaging experiments including sample selection and preparation,\ndescribe basic principles of Computed Tomography, including scanning parameters and reconstruction of 3D voumes,\ncompute structural measures from extracted image features,\nquantify measured structures and present relevant statistics,\nuse high performance computing for training and inference.",
    "Content": "After completing this course, you can use deep learning to analyze 3D volumetric images. To do this, you have gained knowledge of relevant deep learning analysis methods, how you deploy these methods on a computer, and how you prepare data for deep learning. Data is core to deep learning-based 3D image analysis, and you gain experience with annotation tools necessary for preparing training data for segmentation. In addition, the course includes experimental elements, so you learn how to prepare samples to be scanned and are introduced to 3D imaging and CT reconstruction. You will use Python for implementing scripts to solve analysis tasks based on existing deep learning libraries and functions. Finally, you will learn to evaluate model performance, partly through the validation and test data and partly through visual inspection of the obtained analysis result.",
