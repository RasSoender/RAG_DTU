    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to broaden students´ knowledge in life cycle assessment (LCA), equipping them to solve complex problems using advanced LCA methods within sustainable engineering and related scientific disciplines. Participants will obtain skills to perform prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA), propose sustainable-by-design strategies, and conduct environmentally extended input-output analyses. The course prepares students for real-world applications and a career in life cycle-based sustainability assessment in industry or academia.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nRelate the environmental impacts of engineering systems by using advanced life cycle assessment methods.\nUse a commercial LCA simulator (SimaPro) in combination with advanced life cycle assessment methods to reduce the environmental footprint of products and services.\nDescribe how life cycle inventory data can be transformed to represent future changes in the technosphere.\nExtract information from a prospective database.\nAnalyze environmental progress in background systems factoring shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways.\nCalculate environmental learning rates and project environmental progress in foreground systems.\nObserve and critically evaluate the impacts of environmental learning effects on future sustainability potentials.\nOrganize economic and environmental data to form the basis for an environmentally extended input-output model.\nEstimate the environmental impacts of large-scale systems using environmentally extended input-output analysis.\nDevelop sustainable-by-design strategies for reaching absolute sustainability in the framework of prospective life cycle assessment.",
    "Content": "Introduction to prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA). Principles of environmentally extended input-output modeling. Presentation of environmental learning theory and quantification of environmental learning rates. Introduction to background system modelling, shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and integrated assessment models (IAMs). Exploring the sustainable-by-design concept. Linking prospective environmental impacts to absolute sustainability. Practical problem-solving using Python and software tools like SimaPro and MATLAB. Students will learn to critically reflect on the limitations of advanced assessment results for decision support, considering the application context and uncertainties. Participants will discuss and interpret results from a chosen application, formulate technical summaries, provide peer feedback, and present simulation results.",
