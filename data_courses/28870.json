    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course gives insight into various renewable energy technologies, and gives basic information on sustainability and life cycle assessment tools, as well as how energy technologies may contribute to a sustainable future development. This insight will be applied to plan a desirable energy future. Further, it can serve as inspiration for how to consider sustainability issues in your later specialization.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand principles for global development with respect to population, living standard, energy consumption and GHG emissions.\nBasic understanding various renewable energy technologies and correlation of the technologies to resource consumption and environmental impact.\nIdentify and discuss consequences of resource scarcity for the choice of future energy technologies\nExplain the principles of life cycle assessments and discuss possibilities, challenges and limitations in their application\nCritically apply several different quantitative accounting methods to evaluate and compare sustainability indicators of selected energy technologies, systems and services\nEvaluate new initiatives that holistically may integrate and co-develop sustainable use of the resources for energy, fuels, and products, to improve the level of sustainability in society as a whole.\nLearn to search for and critically apply data from different sources.\nPlan a strategic sustainable development of a specific geographical region using backcasting.\nPlan and conduct group work within the area of technologies (energy and products) and sustainability in interdisciplinary international groups.\nSummarize the output of your assignment in an oral pitch and in a short report.",
    "Content": "The focus of this course is on sustainability in relation to energy conversion technologies. We deal with various renewable energy technologies both in respect to technical challenges and opportunities of the technologies and we critically present their pros and cons in respect to general principles of sustainability. The focus is on energy and material flows of relevance to selected renewable energy technologies (mainly based on solar, wind, and biomass) and comparison with fossil based technologies. We will discuss the implications of the interactions between population, energy consumption, living standard and climate change for sustainable development. The selected technologies will be evaluated in a life cycle perspective. Different tools for assessment of sustainable development based on energy and material flows will be addressed, including life cycle assessments, carbon footprint and net energy. In addition, it will be discussed how an innovative integration of energy and materials flows between different sectors in society can improve sustainable development. Tools and strategies will be used to conceive new solutions to moderns societal challenges and in particular to plan sustainable development of the energy sector in a specific geographic area.",
