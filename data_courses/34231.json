    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide tools for the students to analyze and develop modern systems with digital transmission. Emphasis is put on the description of signals and noise as stochastic processes and in conversion of continuous analog signals to digital form. Models are provided for different transmission channels and the signal processing in some basic transmission systems is analyzed. It is the aim of the course to give both an theoretical analysis of the systems and a demonstration of implementations of the signal processing to facilitate simulation of performance.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the fundamental problems of transmission of information\nUse MATLAB for modeling of the signal processing in digital communication\nCalculate correlation functions and spectra for deterministic and stochastic signals\nCreate and analyze Markov models for sources and simple line codes\nCalculate spectra for PAM signals and pulse shapes to avoid ISI\nAnalyze and optimize quantization strategies\nOptimize linear estimation\nDesign optimal receivers for PAM signals and calculate corresponding error probabilities\nOptimize linear equalization techniques\nAnalyze digital quadrature modulation and calculate error probabilities for such",
    "Content": "Introduction to basic problems of digital communication. Deterministic signals. Application of stochastic processes in the description of signals and noise. Sampling and quantization of continuous stochastic signals. Examples of user signals, eg. sound and images. Linear estimation and prediction. Baseband transmission of digital signals: optimal receivers, signal design, and simple line codes. Modelling of physical transmission channels: radio channels and optical channels as AWGN. Modulation techniques: amplitude modulation, quadrature modulation, and digital phase modulation.",
