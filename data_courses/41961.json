    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEstablish non-linear models for simple truss systems.\nUnderstand and apply non-linear solution methods.\nUnderstand and apply relevant error measures for iteration control.\nEstablish the Finite Element Method equations for geometrical non-linear trusses.\nEstablish the Finite Element Method equations for geometrical non-linear shells.\nEstablish the Finite Element Method equations for dynamic systems with damping.\nUnderstand and apply solution methods for dynamic problems.\nPerform a critical evaluation of quality of dynamic calculation results.\nEstablish the Finite Element Method equations for ideal plastic optimization of collaps load.\nUnderstand and apply solution methods for optimization of collaps load.\nProgramme and modify non-linear FEM-programs.",
    "Content": "Introduction to the fundamental theoretical basis for the formulation of geometrical non-linear and dynamic behaviour, as well as optimization of collaps load, and description of the corresponding FEM formulation. Presentation of classic solution strategies and their numerical implementation. The course is structured around lectures and exercises covering both analytical approach, further development of supplied Matlab-code, independent Matlab programming and the use of a commercial program.",
