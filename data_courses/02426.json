    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims at giving the students a solid understanding of advanced methods for random effect/latent variable models. Focus will be on models with clear interpretation of the parameters and a solid understanding of the modern estimation techniques. The models include both non-linear random effect type models for time independent observations and formulation of the marginal likelihood for non-linear/non Gaussian stochastic dynamical systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the Marginal likelihood for random effect models\nApply and understand the Laplace approximation\nFormulate models in the framework of Generalized Linear Mixed effect models (GLMM)\nFormulate and apply random effect model using conjugate priors\nFormulate and implement General mixed effect models, i.e. non-linear/non-Gaussian first and second stage models\nFormulate and estimate parameters in generalized state space models\nFormulate and estimate parameters in non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Models, and interpret local and global decoding\nEstimation in non-linear SDE models using the Laplace approximation\nTransformation of the state space in state dependent diffusion models (e.g. the Lamperti transform)",
    "Content": "Formulation and calculation/approximation, using e.g. the Laplace approximation, of the marginal likelihood for nonlinear random effect models is the core of the course. This include models with explicit solutions for the marginal likelihood and more general models where the Laplace approximation is needed, for example Generalized Linear Mixed Effect model, non-linear and non-Gaussian models. In addition non-linear/non-Gaussian stochastic state space models (e.g generalized state space models) is also presented. The course include both mathematical derivations and practical implementation using TMB (Template Model Builder), and other model specific R-packages.",
