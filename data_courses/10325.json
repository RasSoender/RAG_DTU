    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nToday it is possible to design new materials and nanostructures with special properties by performing computer simulations. Such simulations are based on quantum mechanical models of the systems. The goal of this course is to give you a knowledge of the basic quantum mechanical models and their use, focusing on electronic transport in nanostructures.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nOutline basic ballistic quantum transport\nOutline and apply the Landauer-Buttiker formulation of quantum transport (1D)\nUse single-particle Green's function in time and energy domains\nExplain electronic structure of molecules using LCAO theory (linear combination of atomic orbitals)\nApply numerical matrix algebra to calculate transport\nExplain and do simple calculations of resonant tunneling\nDevelop computer program for calculation of quantum transport for an atomistic description of a nanosystem, f.ex. based on graphene or other 2D materials.\nUse of python for numerical calculations and graph plotting.",
    "Content": "This is an application oriented course on electron structure theory of molecules and solid-state materials, and especially (electron or phonon) transport theory for nanosystems.\nYou will write and use your own computer code written in Python.\n\nYou will be introduced to the theoretical methods enabling you to calculate electronic transport using Green's functions in the first half part of the course. This is done by solving problems and using Python. In the second half of the course you will apply the methods on a concrete problem in a project. The results and their presentation are part of the course evaluation.\n\nThe topics are chosen so as to match active research at DTU Physics. These will therefore change from year to year. Typical topics include: Electronic structure and transport in graphene nanostuctures or other 2D materials, molecular contacts, or 1D nanotubes.",
