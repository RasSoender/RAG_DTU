    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo acquaint the students with efficient statistical methods that may serve as basis for the planning of experiments and research activities. The methods aim at providing precise and reliable data and moreover to reduce the experimental work as much as possible. Methods for reduction of the influence from noise factors on experimental results are presented.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nformulate an adequate experimental design for an experiment in the laboratory or under similar more or less controlled conditions.\nassess advantages and disadvantages of alternative experimental designs, for example with respect to randomization and/or blocking.\nformulate a correct mathematical model for data obtained froma given experimental design.\ntest and estimate the effects in models for experiments with both deterministic and random effects.\ndo detailed analyses of factorial effects by means of adequate contrasts and/or methods for grouping of mean responses.\nto construct experimental designs for factorial experiments with many factors each at (most often) two levels by means of block confounding and reduction through effect confounding.\nuse special methods for statistical analysis of data from block confounded and/or reduced many-factor designs.\nuse and carry out the statistical analysis of data from experiments with measurable sources of experimental noise (covariates).\ndetermine the necessary number of measurements in simple designs.",
    "Content": "Main principles in experimental design: Randomisation and blocking. Balanced designs, square-designs, one or more blocking variables. Balanced incomplete block designs. Factorial designs, blocking in factorial designs, fractional factorial designs and confounding. Multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance.",
    "Remarks": "The course is primarily aimed at students that are going to design experiments and/or analyse experimental data, but the general methods presented are also suited for sharpening the critical sense in experimental work, method development and empirical model building.",
