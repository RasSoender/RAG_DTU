    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to give the students a basic understanding of how chemicals from foods and the environment can affect normal development and cause various diseases. Focus is put on endocrine disrupting chemicals affecting the male, female and thyroid hormone systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the concept of endocrine disruption and the basic principles of toxicology\nDescribe how endocrine disrupting chemicals can affect the male, female and thyroid hormone systems\nOutline classical in vivo study designs used to test and risk-assess chemicals for suspected endocrine disrupting activities\nExplain principles, and give examples of various test methods and strategies for chemical risk assessment\nAssess the likelihood of developing disease based on doses and timing of exposure\nAnalyze how hormones during fetal life impacts on the development of the reproductive and thyroid hormone systems\nEvaluate toxicological data and surmise the likelihood of a chemical causing harm to humans\nObtain a broad understanding of how anthropogenic chemicals can have various effects on human health, including mixture effects",
    "Content": "Humans are constantly exposed to many chemicals from foods, consumer products and the environment in general. Some of these chemicals can have negative effects on our health and cause a wide range of diseases, such as fertility problems, metabolic disorders, lower IQ or cancers. This course will give a general introduction to toxicology with specific focus on chemicals that can mimic or disturb hormone signaling and thereby disturb development of the reproductive or thyroid hormone systems. The course will also cover basic knowledge on chemical risk assessment and regulation internationally. The course will include project work on a specific toxicological problem, where groups of 3-4 students writes and present a report that must be passed to be able to sit an oral exam at the end of the course. The project work is a significant learning tool for this course.",
