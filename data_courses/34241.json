    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim is to enable the participants to develop equipment and applications in the area of digital video applications, including evaluation of video coding methods. Applications encompass techniques for production and storage of digital video, general communications systems for communication of digital media, and Internet applications. The course also addresses digitalization encompassing the application of digital video technology, e.g processing and coding video from drones.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the main components of a typical video coder and decoder\ndefine the hybrid video coding paradigm\nexplain the role of video coding in the internet and digital communication applications\nimplement software components for a video coding and communication system\nevaluate video coding methods in terms of visual quality and compression rate\nsimulate visual communication systems\nselect the optimal video coding techniques under different technical constraints\nidentify which aspects of human vision can be leveraged to compress videos\ncollaborate within a group for a project work related to video processing",
    "Content": "The course focuses on the techniques of digital video compression for communication and Internet applications. Technical aspects of the process from coding to distribution (network/communication, mass storage) are covered. The course treats the principles of video coding, such as block transforms, motion estimation and rate control. The most important standards and formats, i.e. MPEG/h.26x, are presented as well as the relevant compression noise and common noise removal techniques. The main tools for video streaming are introduced: from the basic transmission protocols to methods addressing error prone networks such as packetization, error control or adaptive streaming. The course presents the main elements of the human visual system and explain how its limitations are used to reduce the size of videos while minimizing the perception of resulting distortions. The key indicators used to evaluate and monitor performance both in terms of visual experience and service are covered. Applications of video technology for multimedia such as post-production or digitalization are presented, including for richer luminance and color content such as High Dynamic Range and Wide Color Gamut. Video communication for drones is treated as an example.",
    "Remarks": "The course 34240 is recommended as a supplementary course simultaneously",
