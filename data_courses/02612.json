    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nWhen modelling a technical or economical problem it often happens that free parameters are determined by the solution to an optimization problem subject to some constraints on the solution. The simplest example is that the parameters must be positive or lie in certain intervals due to physical constraints in the underlying physical problem.\nIn this course the participant learns about efficient algorithms for constrained optimization. The student will be able both to develop algorithms and to use existing software for numerical solution of optimization problems with constraints. The course concerns numerical algorithms for linear programming (LP), convex quadratic programming (QP), convex optimization, and non-linear programming (NLP).",
