    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nWhole genome sequencing and bioinformatics has been used successfully in various analyses of infectious diseases such as outbreak investigation and epidemic dynamics. The technology has become so cheap that sequencing platforms are moving into hospitals and food safety laboratories to prevent and control of infectious diseases. The challenge is no longer to generate the sequences, but rather to analyse them and extract the relevant information from the large amounts of sequencing data.\n\nHaving followed this course, you will be able to account for the biological and genetic background of different microorganism causing infectious diseases. Further, by using and creating a number of methods, you will learn how to analyse and interpret microbial whole-genome data in relation to infectious disease and food safety issues.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nBe able to use whole genome sequencing data from different sequencing technologies to check for quality, trimming, mapping, alignment and assembly using command-line based bioinformatics methods.\nApply command line-based methods to analyse species, sub-typing, identify antimicrobial resistance and other important gene markers.\nApply command line-based methods for constructing phylogeny for epidemiological investigations, long-term evolution and large scale phylogeny.\nApply command line-based methods to determine major and minor mutations in pathogen genomes.\nApply command line-based methods to identify and analyse core-genome, accessory genes and pan-genome.\nBe able to download and share sequencing data from/to public databases.\nEvaluate the single components of bioinformatic workflows and pipelines.\nApply state-of-the-art methodologies and tools to analyse and interpret genomic data from humans and various reservoirs (animals, food and environment) and prepare such data for epidemiological analyses and modelling.",
