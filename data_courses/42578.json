    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nBusiness Analytics (BA) is about exploring and analysing large amounts of data to gain insight into past business performance in order to guide future business planning. This course introduces a portfolio of advanced data-centric methods which cover the three main directions in BA: Descriptive (“what happened?”), predictive (“what will happen?”), and prescriptive (“what should happen?”). The methods will be applied to various business cases with aim to demonstrate how to extract business value from data, provide data-driven decision support along with effective data management principles. In this course, advanced machine learning techniques are used so understanding of data science and machine learning basics is required as well as a good level of programming skills is expected.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify business and societal impact opportunities related to effective data utilization\nSummarize the identifying characteristics of advanced machine learning approaches for descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics\nSelect and apply appropriate machine learning (regression, classification, reinforcement learning, clustering) and data management tools (e.g Pandas)\nConduct small-scale machine learning experiments and understand related scaling principles\nApply one or more explainable AI techniques (e.g SHAP, Lime) in data-driven decision advisory situations\nConduct basic analysis of information in a natural language form\nUnderstand the technical principles and potential of foundation models (e.g. LLMs)\nQuantify uncertainties in predictive modelling, through quantile regression and heteroskedasticity model\nUnderstand and be able to explain causal vs correlational relationships between variables\nBe able to provide a clear and informative summary (executive summary) for data-driven analyses and tools, including insights for business and critical questions",
    "Content": "The classes are taught in an interactive manner, with theoretical parts, intermingled with practical exercises. The practical exercises are done in Python.\n\nThe main topics covered in the course includes web data mining; natural language processing; recommender systems; explainable AI; deep learning; reinforcement learning; spatio-temporal prediction models; ensemble models; survival analysis; prediction uncertainty and causality.",
    "Course literature": "Each module corresponds to its own recommended texts, that will be provided in the end of the lecture notes. The mandatory texts shall be publicly available online.",
