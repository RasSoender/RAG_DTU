    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe students will obtain advanced knowledge on how eukaryotic cells work at the molecular level providing them with a global view of the different layers of complexity displayed by living cells, which is necessary to understand human disease, to design disease models and to develop improved industrial cell factories.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nName the fundamental cellular structures and explain their organization.\nUse key features of protein transport in eukaryotic cells to propose a strategy for protein export.\nExplain DNA synthesis and maintenance as well as chromosome segregation in mitotic and meiotic cells.\nUse Mendelian and non-Mendelian genetics to predict patterns of inheritance.\nPredict how defects in the eukaryotic cell cycle affect the cell.\nExplain how defects in cellular processes may underlie human disease.\nPerform simple calculations based on data derived from biological systems.\nAnalyze and interpret experimental results in the context of the course curriculum.\nEvaluate and choose among different molecular biology/biochemistry techniques/approaches for attaining a specified experimental goal.",
    "Content": "The course focuses on molecular genetics, molecular biology and cell biology. A wide range of molecular processes like DNA replication, repair and recombination, transcription, translation, post-translational modifications, protein sorting and cell cycle control will be covered. For simplicity, these topics will initially be described individually and for single cell organisms like yeasts. However, during the course, complexity will gradually increase as we will see how these processes occur in complex multicellular eukaryotes, and how their actions are coordinated via global regulatory networks, for example by signal transduction pathways. In the end, this knowledge will allow us to discuss topics like developmental biology and the molecular biology of cancer. Two recurrent motifs will be highlighted throughout the course: understanding the interconnectedness of physiological processes within the cell, and devising strategies to intervene in these complex processes, either to manipulate a production/model-organism or to develop a cure for a human disease.",
