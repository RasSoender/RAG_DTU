    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course’s intention is to enhance the engineering student’s ability to design structures against earthquakes and wind, by progressively examining the causes of earthquakes and the nature of atmospheric wind, the principles behind the dynamic analysis of seismic and wind loading of structures, lessons learned from the past and structural repair, retrofit and control.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand earthquake generating mechanisms\nDescribe the natural wind boundary layer and the significance of turbulence\nCalculate modal mass and stiffness of a structure\nPerform a seismic response spectrum analysis of structure\nPerform a dynamic linear time-history analysis\nCalculation of peak response of a high-rise building to wind loading\nProbabilistic analysis of wind load process and other effects\nUnderstand lessons learnt from past earthquakes and storms\nGain awareness of structural repair and retrofit principles\nDescribe the most relevant structural control strategies\nFollow Eurocodes 1 and 8",
    "Content": "-Plate tectonics and seismic wave types\n-The wind velocity profile and turbulence intensity\n-The concept of wind and response spectra, accelerograms and pressure time-histories\n-Dynamic seismic and wind analysis methods and principles behind seismic “Force-based” design\n-Introduction to Eurocodes 1 & 8 and the concept of structural ductility\n-Seismic “displacement-based design”\n-Design principles based on experience\n-Structural failure mechanisms and fatigue\n-Structural repair, retrofit and control\n-Static and dynamic response calculation to wind\n-Probabilistic analysis",
