    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nApply thermodynamic property models to analyze and model downstream processing systems. Use systematic methods (graphical, short-cut, systems of equations) to model and analyze technically important multicomponent separation processes. Understand mechanisms for separation (solute transport in different semipermeable membrane types, phase distribution, surface interaction).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDerive expressions for fugacity, enthalpy and entropy from an Equation of State\nUse, and account for, the requirements and limitations the fundamental laws of thermodynamics impose on a given process\nChoose thermodynamic models for liquid- and vapor mixtures with the aim of calculating phase equilibrium and state functions\nPerform simple VLE and LLE calculations for multicomponent mixtures using activity coefficient models, as well as equations of state\nAnalyze separation processes, using graphical techniques\nAnalyze multicomponent separation processes, using modelling\nFormulate and solve simple (non)equilibrium-based process simulation problems\nAnalyze sorption separation processes, using modelling\nDerive equations for solvent and solute transport in pressure driven membrane processes.\nCalculate how concentration and eventually temperature polarization influence the solute transport for the different membrane processes\nDescribe the function of the main used membrane modules and how they are used in different membrane processes.\nCalculate mean flux, selectivity and membrane area for different membrane processes.",
