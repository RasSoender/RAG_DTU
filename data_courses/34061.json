    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course teaches the students applied signal and image processing within the field of interferometric wave-optics, Fourier optics and statistical optics and coherence. The course teaches in scattering of light, Doppler-based interferometry, Fourier optics, optical processing and correlations optics. The students will get an overview of applications for these technologies. The student will practice applied signal and image processing techniques to experimental data from different relevant optical measurement systems.",
