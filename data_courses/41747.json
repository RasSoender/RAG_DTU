    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall objective of the course is to give the students an understanding and knowledge of numerical and analytical modelling of materials and manufacturing engineering with special focus on casting and heat treatment. The students will learn about basic modeling methods for the calculation of temperature and concentration profiles as a result of thermal and mass diffusion. This is achieved by programming the numerical methods themselves. An overall theme of the course is the modeling of the processes by both analytical and numerical methods and the comparison between these methods as a mean to evaluate the validity of the numerical methods.\nThe applied methods are of general nature and can be applied for analysis of numerous processes within the materials and manufacturing industry.",
