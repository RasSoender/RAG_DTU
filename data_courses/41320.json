    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo develop an analytical and physical understanding of the fundamental equations that govern fluid flow and solve them analytically in reduced form in a range of engineering and academic problems. The assumptions in the reduced forms of the equations and their implications on the obtained solutions will be carefully discussed and evaluated. The student will apply the solutions of the reduced equation on relevant engineering problems and evaluate the validity of the solutions based on the respective assumptions made.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain and derive the basic conservation laws of fluid mechanics on differential form\nApply tensor notation to describe flow kinematics and solve flow problems\nExplain and apply the analogy between momentum, heat and mass transfer\nDerive and solve simplified versions of the Navier-Stokes equations, such as the vorticity equation, Creeping/Stokes flow, potential flow, similarity solutions and the boundary layer equations\nSolve and analyze various corresponding simplified flow problems and identify problem formulations that even further simplify solutions of the reduced equations.\nEvaluate the validity and impact of the assumptions used to solve the flow problems\nDiscuss the physical interpretation of these solutions\nUse the boundary layer approximation to solve simple boundary layer problems\nApply the method of normal modes to simple problems of flow instability and identify flow settings with potential appearance of common instabilities\nDocument a technical solution in writing in a short and precise form",
    "Content": "Derivation of the continuity equation, the Navier-Stokes equation and the energy equation on differential form. Tensor notation for describing flow kinematics. Analogies between transfer of momentum, heat and mass. Flow in ducts, boundary layers, free shear flows, Creeping/Stokes flows, potential flows. Similarity solutions and vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation. Linear instability analysis and laminar to turbulent transition. Theory will also be discussed in relation to industrial problems.",
