    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo expand students' understanding of central topics and challenges in medicinal chemistry. To understand and apply concepts from modern medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDemonstrate familiarity with methods for analyzing metabolites and modulating oxidative metabolism; as well as recognize and predict reactive metabolites.\nSuggest relevant use of stable and radioactive isotopes in drug development and diagnostics\nExplain limitations and possibilities for radioactive labeling of molecules in drug discovery, diagnostics and treatment\nDescribe modern principles of prodrug design and apply them to suggest more selective strategies for treating different diseases\nApply knowledge of target classes to design a screening campaign, including assays and required techniques\nExplain the principles behind the design of larger collections of screening compounds and assess the quality of hits and leads in different stages of a drug discovery pipeline\nDescribe and apply state-of-the-art and emerging strategies for peptide drug design and development\nExplain the importance of target identification and validation in a drug discovery pipeline\nExplain and apply concepts in targeted protein degradation",
    "Content": "Lectures and discussions about topics within modern medicinal chemistry, including:\n\nMetabolic reactions, hotspots and use of isotopic labeling to study metabolites.\n\nPrinciples of radiochemistry and how radioactive isotopes can be used in medicinal chemistry, including drug development and for diagnostic imaging (PET, SPECT).\n\nModern concepts for the design and synthesis of prodrugs will be discussed, including tissue-selective activation mechanisms (redox, light, enzymatic, acidic).\n\nDifferent strategies typically employed to design a successful assay will be outlined, and students will be able to suggest suitable screens for diverse target types (e.g. enzyme active site, protein-protein interaction) and target location (cytosolic or membrane-bound).\n\nThe properties that make a molecule a good hit, lead, tool, and candidate will be discussed, with an emphasis on the fact that the quality of compounds in a screening library has a profound impact on the hits that can be identified and progressed through the drug discovery process.\n\nStrategies to identify and validate targets will be outlined. The importance of this crucial step in the drug discovery process will be discussed with recent examples from the literature.\n\nA series of next-generation therapeutics will be presented, including strategies for targeted protein degradation, photoactivatable drugs, carbohydrate-based therapeutics, and stapled peptides.",
