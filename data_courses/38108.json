    "Content": "This course approaches the management of technological innovation from a resource/knowledge based view, which sees technological innovations as a driving force of competitive advantage of organizations through a combination of internal resources and external linkages. Students are introduced to the theories, models, tools and practical cases from industries by understanding what technological innovations are, why they are important, and what are needed to enable and manage technological innovations within and outside of the boundary of organizations. Although most attention will be paid to innovations made by industrial firms, relevant issues of innovations at levels of individual, team, network of organizations, and industry will be addressed as well. The weekly readings consist of a mixture of book chapters, journal articles, and cases. In addition to ‘understanding’ technological innovations, students are also required to ‘practice’ innovations by developing a case study throughout the course and applying the knowledge learned from the course to the innovation case.",
