    "Previous Course": "31784",
    "Not applicable together with": "31784",
    "Academic prerequisites": "46300/02631/02633 , Wind Turbine Technology and Aerodynamics, since knowledge on wind turbine structure and operational behaviour are important in this course. Working knowledge of Python or Matlab programming will be necessary in order to complete the assignments.",
    "Participants restrictions": "Maximum: 32",
    "Responsible": "Michael Courtney , Risø Campus, Building 100 , mike@dtu.dk",
    "Department": "46 Department of Wind and Energy Systems",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give an overview of measurement techniques used in and around wind turbines.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nrecord time series of signals from a wind turbine using a data acquisition system\nexplain the concepts of measurement uncertainty, coverage factor and how uncertainties are combined\nmeasure and analyse wind speed measurements including uncertainty estimation\norganize wind measurements in a database\ndetermine wind resources at a given location\ndetermine wind turbine performance including uncertainty, based on power measurements\ndetermine structural properties for a wind turbine, based on structural measurements\nunderstand the need for wind turbine noise measurements and how these are carried out\nexplain relevant standards for wind turbine measurements",
    "Content": "The course will present an introduction to theory and methods for the experimental determination of wind characteristics, remote sensing of wind speed, wind turbine power performance, mechanical loads and vibrations together with the assessment of noise emission. These topics will be presented in relation to the relevant IEC-standards.\nThe lectures are combined with exercises based on real wind turbine measurements, calibration of sensors and recording of real-time data from a wind turbine sited at Risø Campus, Roskilde. This wind turbine, which will be visited during the course, is fully instrumented for load and power measurements.",
    "Remarks": "If more than 32 have signed up for the course 1st priority is given to students at the M.Sc. in Wind Energy. All assignments need to be submitted and accepted before the examination.",
