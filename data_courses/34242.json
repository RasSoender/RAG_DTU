    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nMachine learning is becoming an indispensable tool for communication engineers. However, as the field of machine learning is broad, identifying a set of relevant tools for solving a specific set of problems may be challenging. The objective of this course is to introduce basic machine learning techniques that can be applied for designing fiber-optic and as well as wireless communication systems. The course will provide the participants' with knowledge of how to: 1) build data driven models of from input/output data. This will include models of amplifiers, transmission channels, transmitter-receivers, 2) design pre- and –post nonlinear equalizers based on multi-layer neural-network. 3) optimal filtering and recover useful information from noisy observations and 4) perform system performance prediction and optimization of communication systems and networks.",
