    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce students to conversion of wind energy, specifically in relation to the fastest possible speed of a wind driven car or the best performance of a wind turbine. The objective is to let the students apply learned theory into practice in solving a design task leading to construction / improvement of a wind car/wind turbine. The final goal is to participate in international competitions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nWork in teams and coordinate across multiple teams\nAnalyze wind car/turbine aero-mechanics based on basic physical principles and laws\nApply composite material fabrication techniques to designs\nFind the areas where you will have the greatest potential to improve performances\nUse engineering measuring methods and application of sensors\nApply engineering design for functional solutions\nChoosing construction methods in relation to functionality and selected materials\nWrite a technical report",
    "Content": "Today wind energy conversion takes place mainly on large scale using MW wind turbines, but the engineering physics and the aerodynamic principles are largely the same as for very small wind turbines. The idea is to build a wind powered car to drive as fast as possible in direct headwind or to build the best performing wind turbine. The students are initially introduced to the competitions, the theory for and mechanics of the existing car/turbine. Assignments targeted at highlighting key fundamental physics and behavior of both the wind car and turbine are solved by the students. In parallel with course lectures, previously built wind cars/turbines are reviewed and based on new ideas / concepts, design and construction of a new or part of a new wind car/turbine is done. Identified core issues for the car/turbine structure are selected based on analysis of the aeromechanics and are solved in groups for each selected area (aerodynamics, wings, shroud, hub mechanics, transmission, control, instrumentation, electrical system, composite material, etc.). The disciplines related to design and construction are for example, aerodynamics, machinery elements, fiber composite, experimental testing, etc. The design tasks are adapted to the prior knowledge and ambition of the students. A key objective is the integration of the various components into a functional and effective wind car/turbine construction. Prior to the competitions the developed designs are tested in the field.",
    "Remarks": "The course is specifically aiming at designing and building for participating in international competitions on the fastest wind-turbine powered car or the best performing wind turbine. The first part of the course consists of a series of lectures and assignments aimed at familiarizing the students with the key physics and technical issues involved for both windcar and wind turbine. Armed with the knowledge and tools obtained in the first part, the students proceed to the last part of the course, where the student / group of students (3-5) identify a core issue for the vehicle's or turbine’s structure/design and thereafter plan and organize further activities to design, build, test and integrate the components. The course is part of Blue Dot project https://blue-dot.dtu.dk/english/dtuwindracers",
