    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give the students hands-on experience of a modern software tool for computational fluid dynamic simulations (ANSYS-CFX). The software will be applied in Chemical Engineering case studies, which will include material transport limitations and mixing studies, heat transfer, adsorption and desorption phenomena as well as the implementation of basic chemical reactions in three-dimensional geometries. The course will be based on the theoretic knowledge of course 28530 Transport Processes, which is strongly recommended as prerequisite course. The focus of the course will however be on the practical use of the software modules that are necessary to implement the fluid dynamic problem. This will include the sketching with help of SolidWorks, meshing, predefinition of the cases, the solving and finally the post processing of the results.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nConstruct and sketch three dimensional technical drawings with help of SolidWorks\nCreate structured and unstructured meshes with help of the software module ANSYS ICEM\nAccount for numerical influences like numerical diffusion and the correlation with the mesh quality\nImplement the physical and Chemical initial and boundary conditions info the software module and perform the solving of the partial differential equations with subsequent post processing of the results\nGenerate advanced visual presentations of the results (vector plots, contour and streamline plots, videos and chart plots etc.)\nApply the CFD software to steady state and transient simulations in problems of diffusion, heat transfer, laminar and turbulent flow, multiphase flow, adsorption and desorption of material, basic chemical reactions, free surface flow, flow through porous material and rotating geometries\nApply the learned methods to a selv-defined project\n-",
    "Content": "Computational Fluid Dynamics Applied to Chemical Engineering problems. Material transport limitions and mixing studes, heat transfer, adsorption and desorption phenomena as well as the implementation of basic chemical reactions in three-dimensional geometries. Transient and steady state simulations for single component, multicomponent, single phase and multiphase flow. Porous Material and rotating geometries. Retention Time Distribution Analysis. The course content helps to consider the sustainable production in relation to the exploitation of raw materials, reduction of waste products and the effectivity of reactor designs.",
