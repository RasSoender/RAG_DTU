    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo obtain the necessary knowledge and skills to plan and design buildings in extreme environments with focus on sustainability and resilience.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify specific challenges of building in the Arctic related to extreme climate, traditional lifestyle, challenging logistics, available skills, energy demand, etc.\nDesign buildings adapted to the local conditions, where resilience is of a major importance.\nJudge the building's energy use and indoor climate in relation to current building codes, changing climate, and environment.\nDesign appropriate HVAC systems (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) for Arctic conditions.\nExplain the availability of solar energy, its positive and negative effects and potential for use in buildings.\nImplement the knowledge of the snow drift phenomenon into the building design considering its effects on everyday life in the Arctic.\nSelect suitable building materials with respect to building traditions, transportation challenges, buildability and sustainability of Arctic construction.\nDiscuss different technical and architectural solutions with stakeholders in a presentation session.\nDemonstrate the obtained knowledge in a structured written report.",
    "Content": "The focus of this course is on building design adapted to Arctic climate (low temperatures, snow, ice, wind, humidity, solar radiation etc.); lifestyle of people in the Arctic; remoteness of the settlements and sustainability and resilience.\n\nCore Elements:\n\n• Architecture, Building Tradition, Lifestyle\n- Learning about the historical and present traditions, habits and activities of people in the north and how they affect the architecture and design of buildings.\n\n• Arctic Climate, Building Envelope, Building Materials, Transportation and Waste\n- Learning about transportation challenges and waste handling in rural areas and how they affect the choice of construction techniques and building materials. Understanding the harsh climatic conditions and the demands they create on building envelope.\n\n\n• Energy, Indoor Climate, HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning)\n- Learning to calculate and evaluate the energy consumption and indoor climate and specify the size and type of HVAC systems needed to ensure comfortable and healthy living conditions in the Arctic.\n\n\nThroughout the lectures the students are introduces to different aspects of designing sustainable homes in the Arctic including architecture and engineering disciplines.\n\nThe knowledge will then be applied in the assignment to design a house for a specific location and users.",
    "Remarks": "The course takes place in Sisimiut, Greenland\n\nThe course shall be taken as part of the Arctic Semester. However, the course can also be taken as a stand-alone course if seats available.\n\nInternational teacher team:\n\nMartin Kotol (Associate professor, DTU)\nAaron M. Cooke (Architect, Alaska)\nWilliam Semple (Architect, Canada)\nKevin M. Smith (Associate professor, DTU)\nGerald Englmair (Assistant professor, DTU)",
