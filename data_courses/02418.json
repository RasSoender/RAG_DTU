    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce some of the most applied statistical methods and to introduce more advanced and theoretical topics in statistics with focus on likelihood theory. The course participants will learn to conduct statistical analysis using the software R. Emphasis will be put on analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. The course is a link between the introductory course and more advanced course offered at the Department.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nFormulate and apply the most common statistical models\nPerform model check and be able to evaluate the adequacy of statistical methods in specific applications\nBe able to interpret and present results from statistical analysis\nHave knowledge about estimation methods, in particular the principle of Maximum Likelihood\nHave knowledge about simulation based methods\nHave knowledge about Bayesian methods\nBe able to perform standard statistcial analysis using the statistical software R\nRecognize the possible use and potential of more advanced statistical methods\nBe able to present statistical findings for an audience without statistical background",
    "Content": "The course will cover the most common methods in applied statistics, usually illustrated with case stories and the statistical software R. Also more theoretical issues are covered. A number of lectures will introduce more advanced topics and thus motivates for more advances courses at the Department.",
    "Remarks": "The course is a link between the introductory course and more advanced course offered at the Department.",
