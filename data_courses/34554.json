    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main objective of the course is to teach students to perform a comprehensive techno-economic prefeasibility study for a utility scale PV plant , utilizing PVSyst to model, simulate, and optimize the plant design for maximum efficiency and economic viability.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUtilize solar resource data to calculate optimal tilt and orientation for a ground-based PV plant, applying principles of solar geometry to estimate initial DC capacity.\nEvaluate PV module and inverter technologies to select suitable components, and design the PV array's sizing and electrical configuration for optimal system efficiency.\nEmploy PVSyst for detailed modeling and simulation of PV plant designs, including the development of a single-line electrical diagram (SLD) and selection of mounting systems.\nPerform a comprehensive energy and financial analys to compare design options, and use PVSyst to perform sensitivity analyses and batch parameter simulations to refine designs.\nDesign the physical layout of the PV plant, including detailed sizing of PV tables and electrical cables, ensuring alignment with standards and project constraints.\nExecute P50/P90 simulations to assess the probabilistic energy yield and financial viability, incorporating risk and reliability into the project analysis.\nCritically evaluate the final PV plant design against industry standards and benchmarks, identifying strengths and areas for improvement in the design process.\nFoster collaborative learning and teamwork by engaging students in group projects focused on PV plant design, encouraging peer feedback and iterative project refinement through presentations and discussions.",
    "Content": "This course thoroughly explores photovoltaic (PV) plant design, employing PVsyst software to cover the design process from site assessment to financial analysis. Throughout the semester, students will work in pairs on a PV plant design case study provided at the course outset, culminating in a presentation at the exam.\nThe curriculum starts with lectures on site assessment, solar data analysis, and the influence of weather on PV performance. Advanced topics include horizon shading, system orientation, row-to-row shading optimization, inverter modeling, and the physical layout design of PV plants, alongside optimization tools within PVsyst.\nGroup presentations throughout the semester offer opportunities for feedback and iterative improvement of the project. The course concludes with insights into contemporary practices in the PV industry presented by invited industry experts, equipping students with the competencies to design efficient and economically viable PV systems.\nThe course is aimed at individuals seeking a comprehensive understanding of PV system design and analysis, emphasizing collaborative learning and practical application. The course prerequisites are 34552 Photovoltaic systems course or an equivalent course or industry experience on the fundamentals of PV systems.",
