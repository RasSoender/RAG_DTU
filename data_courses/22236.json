    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to provide the participants with a basic understanding of immunotherapies and their applications in various disease settings and provide the background on the framework of recent advancements in immunotherapy. Specific focus is given to the technological inventions and challenges, critical for translating efficient immunotherapeutics into standard clinical care.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndefine immunotherapy principles.\nevaluate how immunotherapies influence current treatment approaches in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammation.\ndescribe the different categories of immunotherapy.\ndescribe the cutting-edge technologies and tools for evaluating immunotherapy efficacy and safety.\nidentify the technical challenges associated with clinical translation of novel immunotherapeutic strategies.\nsuggest strategies and tools for precision targeting and patient selection for immunotherapy.\nsuggest an appropriate immunotherapy strategy for a given treatment challenge.\ndevelop an improved understanding of the complexity of experimental evaluation, clinical trial design, and biomarker identification associated with of novel immunotherapies.",
    "Content": "The lectures will focus on the principles of immunotherapy. We provide students with the basic knowledge of immunotherapies and their possible applications in cancer, autoimmune diseases and inflammation. Students will be familiarized with classes of immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors, cellular immunotherapies, cytokines, and antibodies. For example, we will provide knowledge about the recent advancement in immunotherapy based cancer management using checkpoint inhibitors in solid cancers and CAR T cells in haematological malignancies. During lectures we will discuss the tools for evaluating efficacy of immunotherapies and investigating the side effects of the treatment. The course will provide details on patient selection and precision medicine with state-of-art tools and technologies. Moreover, we will discuss the personalized therapy strategies in cancer. Student will familiarize with pre-clinical models and their use in assessment of clinical activity.\nExternal speakers specialized in different immunotherapy approaches will be invited.\nFinal assessment: writing exam, including case discussions and multiple-choice.",
