    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course covers advanced methods for inversion of geophysical and astrophysical data, including machine learning techniques. Case studies from a wide range of inverse problems in Earth and Space physics (e.g. seismic tomography, geomagnetism, exoplanets, ground penetrating radar, galactic emission spectra, gravity) are presented and solved. The emphasis in this course is on inversion methods that handle non-Gaussian noise and use of suitable a priori information to get the most out of the observed data.\n\nPython will be used as a tool throughout the course.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nformulate and solve practical inverse problems with incomplete, noisy data\nuse robust statistical methods to derive models from data, handling non-Gaussian noise\nuse model regularization and a priori information during the inversion procedure\nexplain how to select level of model regularization\nuse of sparsity regularization methods\nexplain the use of Bayesian methods for inversion of geophysical and astrophysical data\nuse Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to find probabilistic solutions to inverse problems.\nexplain relevance of machine learning techniques to problems in Earth and Space physics\nuse backpropagation methods to train feed-forward neural networks for solving inverse problems",
    "Content": "Theory:\nStatistical data description, Maximum likelihood, Model non-uniqueness, null space and resolution, Bayes Theorem, Probabilistic Inversion, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning\n\n\nMethods:\nRobust statistics for non-Gaussian errors, Annihilators, Model regularization, Trade-off curves, Generalized cross validation, Resolution matrix, Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods, Sequential Gibbs sampling, Feed-forward neural networks, Training by Back-propagation, Stochastic gradient descent",
    "Remarks": "The course is aimed at students who want competence in advanced inversion methods and machine learning for use in Earth and Space Physics.",
