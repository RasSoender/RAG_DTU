    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give an all-round knowledge of satellite positioning (GNSS/GPS), geographical information system (GIS), and technical surveying techniques through theory, practical exercises and project work.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the basic theory of GNSS and mention selected systems and their characteristica\nexplain the functionality of survey instruments and commonly used practice and calculation methods\ncarry out a test and calibration of the surveying instruments\nuse leveling instruments, total station instruments and GNSS instruments for surveying and setting out in the field\nmeasure terrain and topography, establish and densify fixed control points network\nanalyse the conducted measurements by consistency checks to detect outliers and estimate the uncertainties of the measurements and the results\ndescribe and transform between various global, regional, and local geodetic datums and reference frames\ndescribe commonly used international and Danish map projections\nvisualize survey data from the field together with existing data in GIS\nperform simple geospatial analysis in GIS\nplan survey and setting out campaigns, choose the appropriate instrumentation and estimate the required effort.",
    "Content": "Satellite positioning (GNSS/GPS) theory and exercises with GNSS instruments for accurate positioning using static and kinematic methods. Use of a total station instrument to measure angles, distances and heights. Measure heights with levelling instruments, including verification and calibration of instruments.\n\nGeodetic datum, map projections, coordinate systems and transformations of data between systems.\n\nError theory (random, systematic, gross errors, and error propagation) and a brief introduction to least squares adjustment of redundant observations.\n\nSetting out of points and lines, including calculating data for setting out and controlling the set-out points.\n\nBasic introduction to GIS, e.g. combining data from own field measurements with existing geospatial data. Introduction to data analysis in GIS.\n\nAfter introducing theory and methods through lectures and exercises, the students carry out projects based on cases from urban and rural areas. In the projects, the learned methods are combined, and the student groups plan, establish fixed control points, survey, set out and analyse the data independently.",
    "Remarks": "Outdoor exercises take place, often in Dyrehaven. Be prepared for all sorts of weather and consider bringing a bicycle for local transport.",
