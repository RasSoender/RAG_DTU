    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course, you will learn how to fabricate micro- and nanostructures, and microdevices in DTUs cleanroom. You will be introduced to the most advanced processes and tools in the cleanroom, and you will receive training in operating some of these tools yourself. You will learn how to engineer a specific micro/nanostructure or microdevice from a starting point defined by its desired functionality, and you will learn systematic methods for how to convert this information to appropriate choices of fabrication tools, process sequences, and characterisation steps.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain principles of operation in terms of the involved physics and chemistry, the advantages, and limitations for the introduced lithography tools, dry etching tools, thin film deposition tools, and characterization tools.\nChoose the appropriate resist for a given combination of lithography tool and pattern to be defined, and optimize the pattern definition and process robustness through application of resist models and exposure simulation models for this resist.\nPropose the most appropriate lithography tool (contact UV aligner, maskless UV aligner, DUV stepper, electron beam direct writing, or nanoimprint lithography), type of resist, UV wavelength (UV tools only), and exposure mode for the chosen tool based on the requirements for critical dimensions, size of area to be structured (throughput), and structure tolerances.\nPropose appropriate methods for pattern transfers such as dry etching, thin film deposition, or pyrolysis of resists, based on the required structure or device functionality, substrate materials (e.g. crystalline Si, amorphous Si, III-V semiconductors, or glass), and the required 3D profiles of structures.\nAnalyze the functional specifications for the structures or devices to be fabricated, propose the appropriate fabrication methods, process characterization methods, and finally a complete process flow comprising the specific process steps, tool settings for individual processes, and interim structure characterization steps based on this analysis.\nDemonstrate the ability to work safely in the cleanroom and proficiency in hands-on operation of at least one tool among the following classes of tools, lithography tools, dry etching tools, thin film tools, or scanning electron microscopy tools.\nIn a small project team, plan and fabricate a specific functional structure or device comprising several fabrication steps and process characterization steps, and document the outcome in a concise technical report.\nDemonstrate effective and agile teamwork, where individual fabrication and characterization tasks are distributed among team members.\nDocument successful fabrication of the structure or device by simple functional tests.\nPresent the outcome of the fabrication and characterization of the structure or device in a conference session format, and engage in peer-to-peer discussion as part of this event.",
    "Content": "In the first half of the course, you will receive a thorough theoretical introduction to the various processes and tools, and you will follow tool package training in the most common lithography tools, electron microscopy tools, specific dry etching tools, and thin film deposition tools. Silicon materials, as well as III-V semiconductors, metals, and carbon will be treated.\nIn the latter half of the course, you will carry out a mini-project in a small team with fellow students with the aim to fabricate a specific micro/nanostructure, or microdevice. You will gain practical experience with specific processes, fabrication, and characterization tools.",
    "Course literature": "Online content and electronic lecture notes",
    "Remarks": "From the start of the course, you will be offered cleanroom safety training, and training sessions for use of specific cleanroom tools. This will take place Wednesdays 8-17, i.e. outside of the teaching modules. Unless you already have these skills, e.g. from 10851/10852, you must therefore be able to reserve a number of Wednesdays for these training sessions in addition to the scheduled course modules. You may consider those training sessions as part of the homework for the course. The training sessions will be agreed on an individual basis for all course students. In connection to the hands-on training sessions, you will also have to do self-study of online materials regarding the appropriate use of specific tools and safety measures. Subsequently, your understanding of these materials will be evaluated through a number of quizzes, which must be passed before the corresponding hands-on training can be agreed. During the mini-project phase, you must be prepared to be flexible regarding organization of your work, as availability of tools in the cleanroom may require working outside of the scheduled course modules.",
