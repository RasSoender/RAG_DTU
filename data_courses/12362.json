    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will give you the basis for measuring, calculating, and analysing room light conditions.\n\nAfter completing the course, you will be able to use state-of-the-art methods and programs to calculate daylight distribution in rooms, artificial light distribution in rooms, shading systems, and energy demand for lighting. You will be able to draw up specifications for daylight and artificial light and on this basis design facades, rooms and lighting.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the photometric quantities and recognize the parameters used to describe the color of a light source.\nIdentify the effects of light on human health and the design aspects that must be considered to provide a healthy indoor environment.\nUse different methods to predict solar angles and propose design solutions for shading devices.\nCalculate solar energy transmittance and light transmittance for window systems with systems for solar shading and daylight control.\nPredict daylighting indoors through simplified methods.\nCalculate light distribution from the lighting system in rooms.\nCarry out simulations to assess lighting and daylighting levels indoors.\nEvaluate daylight availability indoors based on daylight provision static and dynamic methods.\nPredict discomfort glare caused by electric and natural light sources and interpret the results to provide design solutions.\nAnalyze and evaluate the effect of shading systems on daylight, artificial light usage, and visual comfort.\nDesign artificial lighting systems using available products based on the need for light, glare conditions, and daylight.\nSpecify requirements for the visual indoor environment based on Danish building regulations and international standards.",
    "Content": "The course covers fundamental concepts of light and light sources, metrological approaches for quantifying light, specifically photometry and the photometric units used in lighting design. The interaction of light in buildings, optical properties of materials, the effects on vision and health and a brief description of color and colorimetry are also introduced. The design, function, and properties of electric lighting systems as well as methods and tools to calculate electric light and energy performance, are described and practiced through different exercises. The course presents the characterization of daylight sources, design and properties of components in glass facades, solar shadings and daylight directing systems. The course delves into daylight provision while introducing methods and tools for calculating static and dynamic daylight availability in rooms. Aspects of well-being are addressed through visual comfort and view out, visual tasks, and glare. Circadian metrics, perception and occupant behavior, and multi-domain exposures, including light, are introduced. The course presents requirements for lighting design and daylight provision in regulations and codes and available software and tools to calculate the dynamic interaction between the lighting system, daylight and solar shading system.",
    "Remarks": "The course relies on students bringing their own PC. The software used in the course requires a Windows-based PC. The course may be combined with courses 41462,41463, and 12363 because daylight calculations are a natural part of the integrated design of buildings and the development of low-energy buildings.",
