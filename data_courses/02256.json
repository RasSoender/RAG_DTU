    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nReasoning is the ability to make logical inferences. The aim of the course is to give the students an introduction to automatic and interactive computer systems for reasoning about mathematical theorems as well as properties of IT systems. It will cover theoretical insight as well as practical skills in relevant proof assistants.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the basic concepts introduced in the course\nexpress mathematical theorems and properties of IT systems formally\nmaster the natural deduction proof system\nrelate first-order logic, higher-order logic and type theory\nconstruct formal proofs in the procedural style and in the declarative style\nuse automatic and interactive computer systems for automated reasoning\nevaluate the trustworthiness of proof assistants and related tools\ncommunicate solutions to problems in a clear and precise manner",
    "Content": "The natural deduction proof system, first-order logic, higher-order logic and type theory. Formal proofs in the procedural style and in the declarative style using automatic and interactive provers. The Isabelle proof assistant in artificial intelligence and computer science.",
