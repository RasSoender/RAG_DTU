    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nComputer generated models and images are ubiquitous. Classic applications are CAD systems for product design, game engines, computer animation, 3D multimedia, virtual reality, and scientific visualization. With the recent development in 3D scanning and printing technology, work with digitized real world objects has also become an important area of application.\n\nInteractive computer graphics enables us to manipulate digital 3D objects. The ability to work interactively with digital objects is an important engineering skill. Computer graphics is essential both in the classic disciplines, where we model and render digital objects, and in the full cycle from digitization to visualization and manipulation to printing of real world objects. In addition, modern internet browsers support hardware accelerated 3D graphics in webpages that run on both desktop and mobile platforms. This means that 3D graphics will also be used more broadly in the webpages of the future.\n\nThis course provides an overview of interactive computer graphics. Our objective is to enable the participants to (a) implement real-time computer graphics systems and (b) to develop graphics algorithms for and apply them in visualization, modelling, and animation. The course covers web graphics technology and introduces the principles of 3D graphics that one would need to operate in the graphics applications discussed above.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUse an application programming interface such as WebGL or WebGPU for developing a graphics application.\nAccess graphics hardware using shader languages such as GLSL or WGSL.\nCreate a 3D scene with different objects, light sources, and materials.\nUse different camera types and geometries to visualize the scene.\nInteract with the scene using various interaction techniques.\nModel light-material interaction for a surface and develop simple shaders.\nSimulate surface details using texture mapping and bump mapping.\nSimulate the environment using environment mapping.\nSimulate shadows and specular reflections.\nAnimate camera, object position, and light settings.\nRender parametric surfaces based on a selected subdivision level.",
    "Content": "WebGL/WebGPU as an API. Camera models. Transformations and projections.\n3D object representations. Local versus global illuminations models. Hybrid methods.\nReal-time rendering: Shadow, bump, reflection, environment, and texture mapping.\n3D graphics cards and implementing vertex and pixel shaders in GLSL or WGSL.\nInteraction techniques (picking, selecting, rubber banding, events).\nSmooth curves and surfaces: parametric representations (Bézier, NURBS), subdivision (Loop).",
    "Remarks": "Introductory computer graphics course at the M.Sc. level.\nIt is possible to take this course alongside 02562 Rendering - Introduction. The two courses complement each other. However, this course can also be attended independently.\nBachelor student with interest in computer graphics may follow the course.",
