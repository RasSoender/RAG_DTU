    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIntroduction to heterogeneous catalysis, including models of surface reactivity, surface equilibria, kinetics of surface reactions, electronic and geometrical effects in heterogeneous catalysis, trends in reactivity, catalyst structure and composition, as well as electro-catalysis. Selected applications and challenges in energy transformations will be discussed. The participant will learn to theoretically determine good catalysts.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDecompose catalytic reactions into sets of elementary reactions.\nDescribe surface reactivity in terms of the underlying density of electronic states for transition metal surfaces.\nCalculate potential energy diagrams for catalytic reactions based on the energetics of the elementary reaction steps.\nUse the quasi-equilibrium approximation with rate limitation assumptions to approximate catalytic rates.\nUse linear energy relations to determine descriptors for catalytic functionality.\nSolve sets of rate equations for surface processes in the steady-state approximation.\nCalculate volcano relations to determine the optimal elemental catalyst for a given gas-phase process.\nCalculate selectivity plots for catalysts.\nCalculate the optimal electro-catalyst for an electrocatalytic process taking into account the electrostatic potential and pH-effects.",
    "Content": "Basic concepts in heterogeneous catalysis. Systematic, first principles approach to the science of surface reactivity. Unification of heterogeneous thermal catalysis and electro-catalysis. Illustrated by examples, primarily in energy transformations. Key elements: The potential energy diagram, free energy diagrams, surface equilibria, rate theory, surface reaction kinetics, scaling relations, trends in reactivity, activity and selectivity maps, electronic factors in catalysis, catalyst structure, active sites, catalyst screening, and electrocatalysis.",
