    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nGive students the necessary background and competences for assessing stability in electric power systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the principal causes of voltage, frequency, and rotor angle stability problems in electric power systems\nDescribe the different representations of the synchronous machines used for stability studies in electric power systems\nAnalyse voltage stability problems in electric power systems using PV curves\nExplain the key concepts for frequency control in electric power systems\nAnalyse rotor angle small-signal stability problems in electric power systems and describe means to prevent them\nDescribe how the stability problems in electric power systems are affected by grid-related power transfer limitations and generator-related power injection limitations\nAnalyse rotor angle transient stability problems and describe means to protect the system against them\nAnalyse and explain analytical and simulation results",
    "Content": "After a general introduction to the stability problems in electric power systems, the main categories of stability problems are treated, including the mechanisms of instability, countermeasures and theory for analysis. The lectures are complemented by exercise sessions with Python, where study cases are modelled, simulated, and analysed.",
