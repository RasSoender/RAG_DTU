    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nSimulation is an important dynamic tool in design and optimization of production and service systems. The purpose of the course is therefore to learn and understand the advantages, possibilities and limitations of simulation. The course will enable the students to design, implement and use discrete event-based simulation models.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the concept of discrete event-based simulation\nPlan a simulation project for analysis of the performance of the a production or service system and define performance indicators relevant to the analysis\nDesign a discrete event-based simulation model\nImplement the designed simulation model\nVerify, calibrate and validate the implemented simulation model\nAnalyze available data in order to identify and apply relevant statistical distributions to incur stochasticity in the simulation\nPlan a simulation experiment including setting up well-chosen scenarios for analysis of the considered system\nConduct a simulation experiment and analyse and evaluate the results thereof\nPropose possible relevant improvements to the considered system and implement these in the simulation model as well as assess the effect of the proposed improvements\nPresent the completed simulation project and discuss the results obtained",
    "Content": "The course focuses on teaching the students to design, build and use discrete event-based simulation models to analyse problems within operations management. Based upon a wide range of specific complex planning problems, it will be discussed how simulation models can be used to obtain knowledge on the system's operating performance. The students are taught to analyse complex systems within operations management and to define relevant key performance indicators.\n\nThe students are introduced to a discrete event-based simulation tool, AnyLogic, through small-scale practical assignments and introductory lectures during the first week of the course. Hereafter, during the following two weeks, the students are given a more extensive case study in which a specific simulation problem is solved in groups of two students.",

    "Remarks": "The students are encouraged to form groups of two students before the course start. Students not part of a two-person group by the beginning of the course will be assigned to a group to carry out the case study.\n\nPhysical presence is required at the written exam.",
