    "course title": "23272 Risk analysis in food safety",
    "Danish title": "Risikoanalyse i fødevaresikkerhed",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "10",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Food Technology\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Food Technology\nElective course (B Eng), Fisheries Technology",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E4 (Tues 13-17, Fri 8-12)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The lecturing facilitates that the students are active and participate in hands-on activities and discussions (flipped classroom). Half of the confrontation is related to case-studies and project work, and it is expected that students are present and participating actively in most of the lectures. In the confrontation hours, we will focus on hands-on activities and discussions of different topics in risk analysis and examples and group work on case studies given by the teachers.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E4B",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\nThere will be two partial examinations where the student will discuss the use of data from a scientific paper in risk assessment. Moreover, the student must hand in one chemical and one microbiological risk assessment group report. It is a prerequisite for the final oral exam that the student has passed the partial exams and that the reports are accepted. At the final oral examination, the student will draw a question and have preparation time. The final grade will be based on the final oral exam.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course provides a multi-disciplinary approach to risk analysis, focusing on risk assessment and how this is used as decision support for authorities regarding food safety.\n\nIn the course we teach risk analysis based on the methods developed by WHO/FAO and EFSA.\n\nCourse participant will upon completion of the course i) have broad knowledge of how to perform chemical and microbiological risk assessment, ii) be able to assess how expert opinions, scientific reports and papers are used to assess the risk for the consumer, iii) be able to identify the sources of uncertainties and how these uncertainties are integrated into or handled in risk assessments, and iv) be able to interpret results from risk assessments with the purpose of deciding how risks should be managed.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nOutline the elements in risk analysis, and explain how it support authorities to improve the health of the consumers both nationally and globally\nutilize digital methods for prioritizing microbiological and chemical hazards in food\nInterpret the biological mechanisms for how different microorganisms and chemicals cause adverse health effects in humans\nconstruct and use mathematical models and data to estimate the quantitative change of a microbiological hazard in a specific food item from the primary production to the consumption\nUtilizing data to estimate consumers quantitative exposure to a chemical substance when consuming a specific food item\nutilizing dose-response models of microbiological hazards to assess the probability that consumers become ill given the quantitative exposure to a foodborne hazard\nEvaluate dose-response data in chemical hazard characterization to define a point of departure for the possibility of setting a health based guidance value\njudge and utilize results from observational studies, animal experiments, laboratory experiments, reports, expert opinions, etc. in the assessment of human health risk\nanalyze potential sources of uncertainties in data and information and integrate these uncertainties in the risk assessment\nintegrating the effect of natural variation in risk assessments\nAnalyze the interrelation between risk assessment and risk management\nmake decisions about how to manage risk based on results from risk assessments",
    "Content": "The course provides a multi-disciplinary approach to risk analysis in food safety, which is widely recognized as the fundamental methodology that should support the development of food safety standards. Risk analysis is a structured, systematic process that examines the potential adverse health effects consequential to a hazard or condition of a food and develops options for mitigating that risk.\n\nRisk analysis represents a structured decision-making process with three distinct but closely connected components: risk management, risk assessment, and risk communication. The main focus of the course will be microbial and chemical risk assessment, but the participants will also work with risk management.\n\nIn the course, groups of 2-4 persons will be formed by the teacher, and each group will select one microbiological and one chemical case given by the teachers (e.g. Listeria in smoked salmon and lead in fish) on which they will perform risk assessments. On the basis of the risk assessment, they will provide proposals for prevention and control strategies. An active participation in the group work is crucial for obtaining the learning objectives of the course.",
