    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide students with an advanced knowledge and understanding of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) in their entirety and a practical understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of different RAS-components in an operational context. The course will enable students to comprehend the complexity of system operation, and to design and analyse recirculation systems with respect to production and practical issues such as feeding load, production capacity, water quality and system operation and management. The students will learn how to calculate and design basic RAS taking system input and component set-up into account. The students will learn about environmental management issues including sludge handling and end-of-pipe waste water treatment. By the end of the course the students should be able to design a basic RAS as well as be able to evaluate existing systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCalculate system input and predict mass balances for nutrients\nBy hands-on experience evaluate (analyse/measure) important water chemistry parameters\nDescribe the functionality of components and processes in RAS\nAccount for the interaction and interdependency of different RAS-components in an operational context\nAccount for the relationship between system design and system management and the implication on water quality (chemical and microbial) and fish production\nExplain the principles of sludge and waste water treatment\nDesign a RAS taking e.g. species, conditions and operation into account\nEvaluate existing recirculation facilities regarding dimensional criteria, production capacity, system-related operational limitations and weaknesses etc.\nAssess mitigating actions to be taken during instability/fluctuating rearing conditions",
    "Content": "Input and operation of RAS. Components interactions and interdependencies in RAS. Overall design and scaling of RAS. Essential components. Water quality parameters in practice. Technical and operational approaches to solving problems in practical production. Discharge and environmental impact, sludge handling and end-of-pipe treatment.",
    "Course literature": "Compendia, scientific papers and hand-outs",
    "Remarks": "This course provides students with competences relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #2 (Zero hunger), #12 (Responsible consumption and production) and #14 (Life below water)",
