    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course deepens the students´ competences in life cycle assessment (LCA) with a focus on how mathematical models for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) are used to translate life cycle inventories to environmental impact indicators through the computation of fate factors, exposure factors and effect factors. The course puts LCIA modelling in the context of planetary boundaries to enable absolute environmental sustainability assessments (AESA), which aims to determine what it takes for human activities to become environmentally sustainable, as opposed to merely having better environmental performance than a reference activity. The competences gained from this course are useful for advancing impact assessment and communicating the results of LCAs and AESAs to experts and non-experts, which is valuable for pursuing careers in both industry and research.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the role of fate, exposure and effect factors in LCIA modelling.\nCalculate fate, exposure and effect factors for the eco-toxicity and human-toxicity impacts of different chemicals using the USEtox model.\nCompare and contrast the handling of fate, exposure and effect factors for eco-toxicity and human-toxicity in USEtox with their handling in LCIA models for other impact categories, such as climate change or water scarcity.\nDevelop LCIA models for linking elementary flows with indicators of planetary boundaries and other carrying capacities.\nDesign LCIA models and other techniques for quantifying carrying capacities.\nArgue for and against the use of specific principles for allocating carrying capacities to individual activities in AESA, considering fairness and practical applicability.\nInterpret the results of LCAs and AESAs considering uncertainties, methodological choices and value judgement, and communicate the results to both experts and non-experts.\nDevelop your own impact assessment model for a chosen environmental problem and use it to calculate characterization factors that you will then apply to a specific product life cycle in LCA software.",
    "Content": "The course is organized in three themes: 1) LCIA modelling, 2) Linking life cycle impacts to planetary boundaries, 3) Interpretation and decision- support. Each theme involves lectures by DTU staff and external guests, self-study and exercises. A written group case study assignment runs across the three themes.",
