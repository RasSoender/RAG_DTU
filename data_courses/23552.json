    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze customer value proposition\nAnalyse the market potential for new developed products and furthermore to decide about customer segment\nInvent and develop an innovative sustainable food or drinks product by systematic idea generation and to make prototypes of the product\nEvaluate and report the characteristics of the product and the shelf life with regards to safety and quality and nutritional properties\nConceive and design suitable packaging material for new food products with regards to chemical, biological and sensory qualities\nDesign the large scale production of the developed product\nDevelop strategies for implementation and launching of new food products\nDevelop a business plan for the product\nEstablish cash flow projection and budgets on profit/loss, assets/liabilities\nPlan the establishment of a company (Business planning)\nCompete in an entrepreneurship competition",
    "Content": "This is a practical, hands-on course in which you build on competences obtained in other courses in order to invent a new and innovative sustainable food or drinks product in a small group (3-6 students) and produce it in small scale and use it to take part in the Danish Ecotrophelia competition. The product should therefore fulfill the formal requirements as set out by Ecotrophelia (https://eu.ecotrophelia.org/). The course will contain significant extra-curricular work and effort and to be rewarded for this, successful completion of the course will elicit a DTU-Blue Dot diploma. There will be some formal teaching to lead you through a systematic process but the course will be run mostly with the teachers acting in a supervisory and mentoring role. In support of this, you are required to take an online course corresponding to ca. 12 h of work during course 23552. The online course will take you through a series of excercises and theory about innovation and entrepreneurship that are tailored to Ecotrophelia. It is thus highly recommended that you have had course 23101, 23564 and 23532, but if in doubt about your qualifications, contact the course responsible. The product development is based on the team’s own idea, but you are encouraged to work further on concepts developed in other courses, such as 23564 ór 23101.The students will prepare a launching strategy for the product based on a market survey and make a business plan for the production, implementation and marketing of the developed product. The project will lead to a report covering the points set out for the European Ecotrophelia competition, and the course will conclude with a competition to find the group which will represent Denmark.",

    "Remarks": "Please note that the exam will also be the actual Danish Ecotrophelia competition and will only be held once per year - on the day designated for the exam for this teaching module, which is usually at the end of May or start of June each year.\nParticipation in Grøn Dyst (Green Challenge) is highly encouraged.\nEach student is expected to participate fully in the teaching and learning activities and their team's work. It is not acceptable to have other commitments which clash with the scheduled teaching module, which is why teaching is done on Tuesday evenings.",
