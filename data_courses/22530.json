    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main objective of this course is to carry out a project involving Monte-Carlo simulations and experimental work within the field of dosimetry of ionizing radiation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndesign a computation of particle fluence, kerma and absorbed dose for actual medical dosimetry problems.\ncompute the degree of charged-particle equilibrium.\nexplain the basis for transport computations of charged particles (electrons, positrons, and protons) and uncharged particles (photons and neutrons) in matter.\nevaluate the significance of cut-off energies.\nevaluate the importance of variance reduction techniques.\nevaluate the relation between number of histories and the uncertainty related to Monte-Carlo simulations.\nanalyze and simplify model geometries under consideration of computational efficiency.\nestablish a simple model of a linear accelerator or a radioactive source.\napply one or more detector systems for measurement of absorbed dose.\ndesign and execute a critical experimental evaluation of the Monte-Carlo model.\nprogramme and solve a realistic radiation dosimetry problem using Monte-Carlo techniques (main learning objective).",
    "Content": "This three-week project comprises Monte-Carlo simulations of radiation dosimetry and experimental work. The project relates to current research issues in medical applications of ionizing radiation, accelerator dosimetry, or metrology. Problems associated with nuclear reactions (e.g. isotope production) and imaging (e.g. time-of-flight analysis) can be studied. The computations can normally be carried out using the students' own computers. The course consists of the following elements: (i) Lectures (details about the Monte-Carlo code such as TOPAS/GEANT4 and the theoretical basis for radiation dosimetry), (ii) Studying literature related to the project problem (e.g. research papers), (iii) Obtaining physical parameters for the computations, (iv) Measurements and experiments, (v) Modelling, (vI) Student presentations, and (vi) Report writing.",
    "Course literature": "Software manuals.\nIAEA course material.",
    "Remarks": "Depending on the number of students, if may be necessary to split the class into groups.\nThe students will be introduced to safety procedures as part of the course.\n\nFirst week: Lectures on dosimetry and the Monte-carlo tecnique. Installation of the software using TOPAS/GEANT4 on a Virtualbox running the Linux operating system. Define and select project. The application of TOPAS requires that an agreement can be reached with the consortium behind this software.\n\nSecond week: measurements and computations\n\nLast week: Supplementary measurements and computations, as well as report writing.\n\nThe experimental facilities can be found using the link: www.mrdc.dtu.dk\nTOPAS link: http://www.topasmc.org/\nEGSnrc link: https://nrc-cnrc.github.io/EGSnrc/ (alternative code)",
