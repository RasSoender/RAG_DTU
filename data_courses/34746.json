    "Content": "The course deals with novel control methods and concepts in the area of robust and optimal control, fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control.\n\nRobust and optimal control are applied where the controller needs to be independent of variations in the control object, i.e. the effect from the variations on the performance is minimal. Fault diagnosis is applied for detection and/or isolating faults in dynamical systems. Faults can e.g. be a sensor break down, a valve is not working optimal, etc. Fault diagnosis is applied for supervision of dynamical systems in connection with fault-tolerant control. When major changes happen in the control object or in the controller due to e.g. faults in the system, it can be necessary to make changes in the controller/control architecture to avoid undesired stop of production, break down or safety hazards. This can be done in a systematic way by using fault-tolerant control, where the control system is reconfigured or the control object is closed down in a safe way.\n\nThe first part of the course includes an introduction to the other parts of the course.\n\nBoth analysis and design methods will be presented, the participants will work actively with analysis and design and real application cases are used to illustrate the concepts. Participants will work with the latest generation of dedicated software for the analysis and design of fault-tolerant and robust control systems.\n\nA number of small exercises/examples will be applied together with two larger assignments with associated test setup in the laboratory.",
