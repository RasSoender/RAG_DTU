    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the student with broad knowledge in the field of molecular evolution (i.e. the evolution of DNA, RNA, and proteins). It is in particular the aim to provide the student with experience and in-depth knowledge of model-based methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction and hypothesis testing in an evolutionary context. Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to attract a diverse range of students.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\naccount for natural selection and the neutral theory of molecular evolution.\nsolve simple population genetic problems.\naccount for important properties of phylogenetic trees.\nconstruct phylogenetic trees under the parsimony, distance, and maximum likelihood criteria (using the PAUP* program); construct Bayesian phylogenetic trees (using the MrBayes and BEAST programs).\nuse the Fitch algorithm to manually compute the length of a tree given an alignment; use this as the basis for selecting the most parsimonious tree(s).\naccount for substitution models based on Markov chains.\nmanually compute the likelihood for a phylogenetic model given a set of parameter values and an alignment.\nuse model selection criteria (e.g. likelihood ratio testing and AIC) for selecting the best of several alternative phylogenetic models.\nuse the PAML program package to detect positively selected sites in a protein-encoding gene.\nuse R (eg. RStudio) for manipulating, plotting, and analysing phylogenetic trees.",
    "Content": "Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.\nMechanisms of molecular evolution. Models of DNA and protein substitution. Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using distance based methods, parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques. Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, molecular clock models, codon models and analysis of selective pressure). Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, bootstrapping, AIC, Bayesian statistics).\n\nThe student will acquire practical experience in the use of computational methods by analyzing sequences from the scientific literature.",
