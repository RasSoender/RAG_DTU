    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students an understanding of the use of microprocessor peripheral circuits in instrument systems and intelligent devices with systems engineering processes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndevelop microprocessor programs in C\napply SPI-, I2C- and/or UART-bus/interface based peripheral components\nimplement sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, thermometer, distance meter,...) for measuring physical variables\napply the build-in functions of the microprocessor\nexpand a microprocessor system with external memory\nuse analog-to-digital converters in a microprocessor based measurement system\nuse the microprocessor to calibrate and linearise digitised measurements\nuse advanced components for digitalisation of sensor signals.\ndesign a microprocessor-based instrumentation system and its software and/or firmware with standard processes (milestone, requirement specifications,...) of systems engineering.",
    "Content": "The course consists of laboratory work. There are no lectures, but there will be a brief introduction to each exercise.\nDuring the exercises, a number of microprocessor-based systems with serial interface to peripheral components like AD converters, digital sensors, memory, and LCD displays are developped. In the last part of the course, a self designed larger instrumentation project is implemented, where system engineering processes are used.\nThese exercises/project shall be documented in reports.",
