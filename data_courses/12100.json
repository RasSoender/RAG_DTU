    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nPolytechnical foundation (MSc), see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral competence course, MSc.

    "Schedule": "F7 (Tues 18-22)\nThe course is designed based on the teaching concept of the Flipped Classroom, which focuses on student-centered teaching and active learning. For the course's teaching approach, this means that students watch the video lectures and read articles prior to the teaching session, and the session itself is concentrated on students' active interaction with teachers and exercises.\n\nEach teaching session during the 13 week period is scheduled for 2 hours in the schedule F7.",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby\nThe teaching sessions will take place at Lyngby Campus. For a smaller subset of students, it may be that the teaching will take place at the location where the respective candidate is based (e.g., Hirtshals, Ballerup, and Kalundborg).",
    "Scope and form": "The student is expected to study video lectures and read articles before the in-class teaching. In order to create time for active learning with exercises together with the teachers. The in-class teaching is therefore focused on studying exercises and doing calculations on sustainability. Supervision and feedback in the in-class teaching will be with teaching assistants (13 out of 13 weeks), module teacher (10 out of 13 weeks) and case study teachers (3 out o 13 weeks).",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "F7, F7, The written exam takes place in F7. The Reexam is placed in F7 in the reexam period.",
    "Type of assessment": "Written examination and reports\nTo pass the course the student must submit all mandatory elements (tasks and peer feedback) for the case study. The final assessment of the student is based on a multiple choice quiz (60%) and the case study task 3 (40%). To pass the multiple choice quiz, the student must achieve at least 35% correct answers. If the minimum of 35% is not achieved for the multiple choice quiz, the student will not pass the course.",
    "Exam duration": "Written exam: 2 hours",
    "Aid": "All Aid - no access to the internet :\nCase study: All aids - with internet access.\n\nMultiple choice quiz: All aids - without internet access.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course provides the understanding and quantitative tools needed by engineers and scientists to create engineering solutions for a sustainable society within their own educational disciplines. The students learn about terms, definition, and units related to sustainability, the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability and the importance of geographical and temporal scale when considering engineering solutions. Focus will be placed on understanding sustainability and developing sustainable solutions from an industrial perspective.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe and critically reflect on the environmental, social, and economic considerations and challenges to creating ‘sustainable engineering solutions’ in practice across multiple geographical and temporal scales\nCritically evaluate sustainability in current practice across the three Sustainability Pillars; environment, society and economy\nAnalyze and quantify, from a life cycle perspective, the sustainability of a chosen product or service through a group assignment using the sustainability tools introduced during the course\nApply current state-of-the-art tools to quantify sustainability whilst considering the complex interlinkage of sustainability challenges currently faced within climate change and the sources impacting climate change, effects on human health and the environment, effects on biodiversity of ecosystems, and the scarcity of certain resources\nExplain the uncertainties associated with sustainability assessments\nExplain the importance of a systemic perspective when assessing the sustainability of all technology and practices considering the current and future technological, environmental, social, and economic landscape\nDescribe main components of an absolute environmental sustainability assessment\nCritically engage with the principles of life cycle assessment (LCA) in practice by evaluating the outputs of several life cycle assessments\nDescribe the principle of Circular Economy and how that affects societal flows of resources",
    "Content": "• Terms, definitions and units describing sustainability, impact challenges to sustainable engineering solutions (Emission and climate change, Impacts on human, environment, scarcity of resources), social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, absolute environmental sustainability assessment, circular economy (definitions, reasons, and drivers), principle of life cycle assessments, quantitative tools for evaluating sustainability",
