    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo teach you to use and evaluate available processes for fabrication of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices and understand the equipment and the methods used in fabrication. Based on this knowledge, make detailed process descriptions for the fabrication of integrated circuits, semiconductor devices, and microsystems, evaluate the results of the processing, and understand the connection between the physical models used and the fabrication procedure used.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUse analytical â€“ linear or nonlinear - modelling for a first optimization iteration of a process sequence development and use analytical modelling to assist interpretation of numerical modelling results\nAccount for the interaction between diffusion, oxidation, and nitridation mediated by point defects, and predict the results of these effects on a fabrication process\nAccount for the fundamental physics of molecules and atoms in a vacuum chamber and the basic equipment used to produce and measure vacuum and for the use of DC- and RF-generated plasmas for deposition and etching\nAccount for how deposition process parameters affect film properties including step coverage and trench filling, and use this understanding to optimize deposition process parameters to meet target specifications if at all possible\nAccount for how etch process parameters affect the etch performance including selectivity and anisotropy and based on this tailor the etch parameters for target specifications\nAccount for how silicon crystal growth conditions affect the material parameters and interfere with further processing of the wafers, and based on this knowledge select the proper starting wafers for an application\nAccount in detail for the physics and photo-chemistry of UV lithography and be able to use this knowledge to optimize the lithography process even in the case of image reversal processing\nChoose the proper doping method for a specified application and understand in detail the consequences of the choice in terms of thermal budget, defects, possible doping level, and control",
