    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will enable the students to apply their theoretical knowledge in materials science (mainly, metallic materials and polymers) for solving an experimental task, which is inspired by needs from research or industry. Project work comprises all stages of a project, including planning and performing relevant laboratory investigations as well as interpretation of experimental results. Students will obtain insights into project work on real cases.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nidentify necessary working tasks for solving a project,\ncarry out metallurgical processing of samples,\nevaluate possibilities and limitations of experimental methods for materials characterization and testing with special focus on the complementary information of various methods,\nsuggest and apply a suitable routine for experimental investigations and establish an experimental plan,\nunderstand and operate equipment for investigating microstructure and properties,\ncarry out sample preparation, microstructure characterization and measurements of materials properties,\nanalyze scientific publications related to the project,\ndiscuss experimental results of own project work in relation to theoretical expectations and literature reports.",
    "Content": "Materials processing and synthesis by heat treatment, thin film deposition, plastic deformation. Materials characterization by microscopy, diffraction analysis and spectroscopy. Materials testing in terms of mechanical properties and corrosion. Literature study and discussion about materials phenomena as well as mechanisms for tailoring microstructure and properties. Relation between processing – microstructure – properties – performance of materials. The course conveys all steps of project work including planning and performing experimental work, handling of samples and results, reporting.\nProjects correspond to real cases from industry and research and, therefore, reflect examples of applying theoretical knowledge in materials science to relevant practical work.",
