    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of the course is for the student to be able to understand different concepts of sustainable cooling and heating of buildings. You will be able to design and dimension all parts of a heating/cooling system (emission system, distribution system, storage system, generation system) and calculate energy performance for all type of buildings (residential, commercial and industrial).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDesign and dimension low temperature heat emission systems (floor heating, radiant heating)\nDesign and dimensioning a high temperatur cooling system (radiant surface cooling)\nSelect an appropriate heat generation and coolling system (boiler, heat pump, district heating, solar thermal system)\nSelect an appropriate control system\nDesign and dimension a domestic hot water system\nCalculate yearly energy performance of heating/cooling systems according to EN standards\nExplain the principle for hot water storage\nShow overall understanding of energy consumption in buildings",
    "Content": "The course will include the basic concept of water based heating and cooling systems in residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The course will focus on the use of low temperature heating and high temperature cooling systems combined with the use of renewable energy sources.\n\nThe course deals with concepts for design, dimensioning, influence on the indoor environment and control of water based heating/cooling (floor, wall, ceiling).\n\nControl of the water based energy distribution system.\n\nThe use of energy storage systems like hot water tanks will also be included.\n\nThe application of heat generation and cooling systems like boiler (gas, oil), heat pump, district heating, solar thermal system, chiller will include calculation of energy performance, control, dimensioning.\n\nConcept of domestic hot water systems including production, dimensioning, circulation, energy performance, legionella.\n\nBesides the course deals with the overall relation between building and system and overall primary energy performance of building and heating/cooling system and optimisation for use of low temperature heating and high temperature cooling systems and renewable energy sources.",
    "Remarks": "The course material consist of a REHVA guidebook (Low temperature heating - High temperature cooling) and lecture notes.",
