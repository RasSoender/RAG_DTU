    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nGeneral course objectives:\nTo provide students with a fundamental knowledge about Lower Trophic Aquaculture (LTA), including culture technologies, environmental interactions, and the cultivation of different species of shellfish, macroalgae, microalgae, crustaceans, and gastropods. Students will become familiar with basic concepts in LTA and the biological and technical background for the cultivated species. The students will be introduced to different farmed species through different practical exercises and excursions to commercial production sites and companies. The students will learn the processes and requirements for controlled life cycles of different species in LTA starting from the hatchery and through to grow-out. Students will be able to identify low trophic species’ physiological parameters used for growth models and plan a production cycle. The course will familiarize the students with the management and technology used in hatcheries, hatchery processes, and aspects of biosecurity. The students will be able to cultivate different species in LTA through the application of appropriate husbandry techniques and technologies. Lastly, students will become familiar with the role of LTA in watershed nutrient cycles, coastal ecology, and the ecosystem services that LTA can provide from an environmental management perspective.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nProvide an overview of the main produced species in LTA.\nExplain the requirements for the different species life cycle.\nIdentify the different phases of low trophic species aquaculture: from juveniles to grow-out\nList the biosecurity measures for LTA.\nConduct and plan production cycles of different species.\nOrganize logistic and monitoring program for managing LTA production.\nReport on how to establish a new LTA business.\nDemonstrate the role of LTA species in ecosystem services.",
    "Content": "Introduction to low trophic aquaculture and most common cultivated species.\nLife cycle and production system of low trophic species.\nFeeding and nutrition of low trophic species.\nLow trophic hatchery practice (shellfish and macroalgae) and facility at DTU Aqua.\nGrow out practice and facility at DTU Aqua and industry.\nIntroduction to integrated multritrophic aquaculture (IMTA).\nRole of low trophic species in the ecosystem and services provided.\nRisk associated with low trophic aquaculture (e.g. biosecurity measures, climate change).\nSite selection for low trophic species farming.\nManagement and regulation associated with low trophic aquaculture.",
