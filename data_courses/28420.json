    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the participants to use systematic methods in order to model, analyze and simulate technically important separation processes. Graphical and short-cut methods, as well as mathematical methods are employed. Equilibrium and rate-based methods are considered. The participants will aquire knowledge about, and experience with the foundations of computer-aided tools for process simulation, design and analysis. Multicomponent separations are emphasized.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAppraise and evaluate the importance of separation processes in chemical and biochemical industries\nAnalyze separation processes, using graphical techniques\nAnalyze multicomponent separations, using modelling\nDesign multicomponent separations, using systematic methods of solution\nSelect a suitable separation technique\nEvaluate separation processes using computer-aided tools\nFormulate and solve simple equilibrium-based simulation problems for multicomponent separations\nDesign simple sequences of sorption separations",
    "Content": "Separations based on the mechanisms of phase creation, agent-addition, solid agent and to some (though a lesser) extent force field or gradient creation. Barrier-based separations are covered in a course dedicated to membrane technology. All topics are studied using combinations of diagrams, short-cut approaches and simulations. Extension of methods for separation of 2-3 components to multicomponent distillation and liquid-liquid extraction. Extraction cascades.\nSpecial separation processes: Selected topics, such as azeotropic separation, extractive distillation, salt distillation, batch distillation, non-equilibrium. Sorption separation processes: Adsorption, ion exchange and chromatography: Sorbents, modeling and operational modes. Databar exercises with programming: Simulation of special and selected processes: MESH/MERSHQ equations. Process Intensification. Introduction of research topics. Advanced process analysis.",
    "Remarks": "An ability to use the techniques, skills, and tools provided in this course, are necessary for the practice of chemical engineering in order to analyze how separation process design and selection affects the sustainability of processes and processing routes.",
