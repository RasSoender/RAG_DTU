    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course covers advanced analysis, design, and construction topics related to both concrete and asphalt pavements. Its main objective is to elevate and enrich the knowledge level of the students in order that they could understand the basic assumptions and limitations underlying existing state-of-the-practice methods, and also that they would be able to appreciate and critically evaluate new ideas.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand how pavements behave under service conditions\nRecognize and explain construction and design parameters that affect performance\nApply layered elasticity theory to analyze mechanical responses in asphalt pavements\nPerform inverse analysis of pavement layer properties\nImplement linear viscoelastic theory for material characterization\nApply plate theory to analyze mechanical responses in concrete pavements\nClassify common concrete pavement distress types\nCreate pavement mechanics computer codes",
