    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\n(Generally) To learn to formulate and analyse relatively simple dynamic probabilistic models. (Especially) To be acquainted with some models of this type which have proved practically usable.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDifferentiate between different types of stochastic processes, and determine which model class that is most relevant for a certain dynamic phenomenon\nSimulate realizations of a Markov- or renewal process\nClassify states of a Markov process and the process itself\nDetermine invariant distributions in Markov processes\nDetermine simple time varying transition probabilities in Markov processes\nFormulate and solve equations for time to absorption or expected time to absorption in Markov chains.\nFormulate discrete time Markov processes, which arise from different sampling techniques in continuous time processes\nIdentify and analyze important special cases of Markov processes, e.g. birth and death processes and fundamental queueing systems\nPerform calculations in models based on Brownian motion\nWorking knowledge of different probability generatingfunctions\nIf time allows get some knowledge on martingales",
    "Content": "The topics are: Markov chains in discrete and continous time, renewal and Markov renewal processes.",
    "Remarks": "The course is a good supplement for courses in statistics, operations research, time series analysis, image analysis, and control theory.",
