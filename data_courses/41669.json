    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to enable the students to:\na) characterize the different processes of surface technology with respect to their potential and limitations,\nb) tailor surface properties with Surface Engineering principles,\nc) propose innovative surface engineering solutions to optimize materials properties and performance, also taking environmental sustainability into account.\n\nThe course enables the students to work purposefully in professional networks on solving materials challenges in many fields, among which machine and tooling industry, medico-technology, joining of materials (welding, soldering and bonding), chemical industry, off shore, etc. The course enables the participants to solve wear, tribology and corrosion problems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nclassify surface technology processes and coatings systematically\naccount for production processes for various types of surface modifications based on electrochemical, chemical, physical, thermal and mechanical methods, and combinations thereof\nspecify surface engineering solutions for complex materials challenges\nacquire research-based knowledge within specific areas of surface engineering\nidentify significant challenges concerned with interactions between the coating and the base material (fatigue, hydrogen embrittlement, corrosion etc.)\ncalculate material and energy consumption in connection with deposition processes\napply multidisciplinary knowledge from physics, chemistry, mechanics, medico-technology, design etc. to create innovative solutions involving surface engineering\nevaluate alternative surface engineering strategies for achieving specific materials performance",
    "Content": "The course deals with the following surface technologies: chemical/electrochemical processes, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, ion implantation, thermal spraying, mechanical treatments, anodizing, hot dip galvanizing and thermochemical processes, as well as their typical applications as: hard, wear and (high temperature) corrosion resistant coatings, high temperature coatings.\nThe course enables the student to select an appropriate surface technology for a specific application.\nImprovements of the surface qualities by either deposition of thin/thick coatings or surface modifications of the original material will be evaluated with respect to, for example, wear, corrosion, electric conductivity, soldering/brazing, reflection, friction.\nSustainability and life cycle problems are discussed in connection with the different processes.\nThe processes are illustrated with several cases form industry and scientific research.",
