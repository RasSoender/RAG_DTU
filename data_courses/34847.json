    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course focuses on conceptual design and prototype development of innovative products. In an increasingly globalized world, employees capable of coming up with innovative ways to define concepts for new designs and for the subsequent production process are an invaluable resource. In addition, the complexity of products is increasing continuously. To master these challenges, employees with different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds must be able to collaborate efficiently in short windows of opportunities.\n\nThe objective of this course is to improve the student's ability to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries in an innovative and process driven way, while at the same time, being cognizant of the environmental impacts of the solution over a given product’s whole life cycle.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCan explain how conceptual designs can take into consideration the needs from users\nCan explain examples of prototype development of innovative products.\nCan summarize basic concepts of Life Cycle Assessment\nCan propose and justify the value of new innovative, technical solutions\nCan conduct disciplinary analysis of a real-life industrial problem\nCan present disciplinary analysis to stakeholders with different disciplinary backgrounds\nCan participate in a multidisciplinary team and take responsibility for their own role in the process\nCan propose and objectively assess the environmental impact of different solutions\nIs able to operate in a conceptual design process\nIs able to understand and utilize the needs and insights of users/customers/stakeholders in the innovation process\nIs able to independently describe and asses the trade-off between different factors such as performance, functions, materials, quality and price, as well as sustainability/footprint",
    "Content": "The project work is based on multidisciplinary collaboration with students from different programs and universities across Denmark . Students are taken out of their conventional classroom environment with teacher-led learning and are instead placed in a dynamic industry environment to be enrolled in a real problem-based learning approach within a multidisciplinary setting.",
    "Remarks": "The course is an all inclusive package, where accomodation and all foods are included. All participant must pay a fee that will contribute to cover these expenses.",
