    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nMain objective is to give the student a general understanding of the dynamic response of structures loaded by random loadings like, wind, waves, traffic etc. The focus of the course is on understanding why the response is nearly always normal distributed, and that this naturally leads to the use of correlation functions and spectral densities, and how these quantities should be understood and estimated from real data. The course is based on exercises in Matlab.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine and estimate probabilistic quantities like mean values and variances from response data\nDefine correlation and explain how the concept can be used to extract physical information\nDefine auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions and explain how they can be used to extract physical information\nUse numerical methods to estimate auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions\nExplain classical Fourier transforms and use digital Fourier transforms to process response data in Matlab\nDefine spectral density functions and explain how they can be used to extract physical information\nUse numerical methods to estimate spectral density functions\nOutline and describe the concept of linear systems and use Matlab to perform simple response simulations",
