    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course provides a multi-disciplinary approach combining the disciplines of conventional microbiology, whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics to characterize antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. Antibiotic resistance will be evaluated both through conventional phenotypic methods and through genotypic approaches. Bioinformatics software will be applied to further characterize bacterial genomes in relation to development and transmission of antimicrobial resistance, as well as for evaluation of genetic relatedness between bacterial isolates.\n\nThe student will upon completion of the course i) be able to perform phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing, ii) be able to perform whole genome sequencing of DNA from bacteria, iii) be able to conduct bioinformatics analyses to determine the taxonomic identity, as well as presence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, and iv) be able to interpret the analytic results with the purpose to explain concerns and actions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the history and classification of different antimicrobial agents\nDescribe the mode of actions of antimicrobials and the biological mechanisms of resistance\nExplain the threat of emerging antimicrobial resistance to critically important drugs, including in a One Health context\nOutline different surveillance and monitoring approaches for antimicrobial resistance\nPerform qualitative and quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing, including quality control measurements\nPerform library preparation and whole genome sequencing of bacterial isolates through current WGS technologies\nPerform bioinformatics analysis and characterization of single genomes including taxonomic and type identification, prediction of plasmid content, identification of genetic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, and cluster analysis\nIdentify clusters and possible transmission routes of bacterial pathogens\nUtilize the knowledge acquired to elucidate the spread and potential impact of antimicrobial resistance and/or important bacterial clones\nEvaluate possibilities and actions to hamper or limit further transmission of antimicrobial resistance",
    "Content": "The course provides a multi-disciplinary approach to assess antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens to understand this emerging global threat.\n\nThe course will focus on the theoretical background of development of antimicrobials, as well as their classification, modes of action and usage for treatment, and bacterial physiology, epidemiology, acquisition of resistance, presence and transmission of mobile elements, methodologies for phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and interpretation of results.\n\nThe course provide hands-on laboratory experience in both conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole genome sequencing technologies of single bacterial isolates. Further, introduce bioinformatics analysis to determine antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, to elucidate genetic relatedness and to characterize bacterial genomes in a One Health context.",
