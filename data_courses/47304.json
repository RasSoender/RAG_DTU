    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nCeramic materials and their continuous development have dramatically influenced our daily life. The perception of ceramics as pottery, dishes, bricks, tiles, glasses or cement has changed through the development of novel structural and functional ceramic materials that are gradually finding their way into advanced technological applications. These applications are as diverse as spark plugs, fibre optics, artificial joints, space shuttle tiles, race car brakes, micro-positioners, chemical sensors, self-lubricating bearings and body armor, indicating the huge dependence of future technologies on advanced ceramic materials.\n\nThrough lectures, group work and laboratory exercises as well as contact with industry, students will get an overview of traditional and advanced ceramic materials, including different applications, properties and structure of ceramic materials, and their production methods and characterization. The students will also get training in literature search and report writing. The completion of this course enables the students to select optimal ceramic materials with required properties, design a product and fabricate it using an appropriate method for a given application. Overall, this course will equip the engineering students with the necessary tools for their future career in industry, research or as decision makers.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the crystal structure of ceramic materials\nFind and analyze the phase diagrams of ceramic materials\nExplain and calculate the physical, mechanical and functional properties of ceramic materials\nSelect a ceramic material for an industrial application\nExplain different methods for processing, forming and sintering of ceramics\nSelect and analyze ceramic processing methods and design a fabrication process for producing ceramic engineering components with focus on technologies for sustainable change, such as ceramic fuel cells, electrolysis or membranes\nUnderstand the use of electron microscopy, surface area measurements and thermal analysis for the characterization of ceramic materials\nAssess safety of and perform a practical laboratory task on the sintering and characterization of ceramics",
    "Content": "Properties of ceramic materials: physical, thermal, mechanical, electric, magnetic, chemical and optical. Phase diagrams (binary and ternary), crystal structures.\nTreatment of ceramic powders. Shaping of ceramics: pressing, casting, plastic forming. Drying and sintering of ceramic bodies.\nCharacterization of ceramics: X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, thermal expansion (dilatometer), particle size and particle size distribution, measurement of strength, toughness and hardness, surface area (BET), porosimetry, optic microscopy, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy.\nToughening of ceramics. Design of ceramics. Fabrication and use of ceramics in a sustainable society.",
