    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of the course is to enable students 1) to apply lean prototyping methods for UX design of personalized user interfaces, and 2) to select appropriate tools, methods and designs for the tasks at hand.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify user needs and pain points for a market segment\nOptimize unique value proposition (UVP) using a lean business model canvas\nModel user needs hierarchically as goals, activities and tasks\nPrioritize user needs to sketch out UX prototype designs as wireframes in a story boards\nModel microinteractions for a UX system design\nIdentify backend interaction required for a UX system design\nSelect and implement appropriate design patterns for a UX prototype design\nDesign a minimum viable product (MVP) based on iterative UX prototyping using Build-Measure-Learn cycles\nValidate a minimum viable product (MVP) using hypothesis driven design methods\nDescribe methodologies and design principles of a digital product: Design Thinking, Transformation vs Innovation, Ethics and Bias\nDescribe (additional) key processes that are necessary when developing a digital product: Agile, Lean and Build-Measure-Learn\nDescribe additional concerns when a digital product transitions from the development phase to production: Scalability",
    "Content": "The course is focused on development of functional UX design prototypes that combine multiple mobile devices and interfaces, from flat UI to dialog and voice based design patterns.\n\nIt uses lean methods based on pain driven design, hierarchical user story mapping, multidevice design patterns and microinteractions system design, as well as rapid prototyping combining both industry proven and novel tools and methods.\n\nThe course provides students with a systematic foundation and practical experience in designing UX prototype designs, which can also later be applied to \"next generation\" interfaces in other domains, subsequently addressed in 02266 \"User Experience Engineering\".",
    "Remarks": "The course is part of DTU Compute's Digital Innovation Canon.",
