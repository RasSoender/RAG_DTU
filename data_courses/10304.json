    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students knowledge of the atomic-scale physics prevailing at the interface between solid and gas/liquid phases. This is of fundamental importance if you want to understand technologically important processes, e.g. catalysis, adhesion, tribology, and mechanical and chemical properties of new nanomaterials. The course aims at giving the students an overview of the most applied methods and an introduction to how these can be used to study realistic problems within the surface physics area. The student will during the course independently perform experiments on advanced equipment, such that hands-on experience with some of the methods is acquired. An important part of this course is the combination of experiments, report-writing, and oral presentations in order to give the students experience with evaluating the individual methods for solving specific problems and to read the relevant literature.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain phenomena which are responsible for the structure and composition of surfaces.\nExplain the physical phenomena which are responsible for adsorption on surfaces.\nExplain general tendencies in surface reactivity and surface energy.\nDetermine nanoparticle structure and stability under vacuum and in reactive atmospheres.\nAnalyze catalytic processes by simple models.\nExplain the most important catalytical processes and describe the most significant technical obstacles.\nExplain how nanoparticles in the future may provide solutions for future energy conversion.\nExplain in detail the principles of methods for surface analysis, and why they are surface sensitive.\nDetermine which method is most appropriate for a certain problem like for example determining the surface composition.\nPerform a critical and comparative evaluation of results obtained with various surface sensitive methods.\nEvaluate the different methods on the obtainable results, time, and investments.",
    "Content": "Quantum mechanical description of the physics and chemistry of clean surfaces, including the electronic and structural properties. Description of electron structure of adsorbates of the surface, epitaxy, adsorption/desorption mechanisms, chemisorption and the dynamics of chemical and physical reactions. Description of the prerequisite for experimental studies of these surfaces under well-defined conditions - this is ultra-high vacuum (UHV) with base pressures below 10E-13 bar. The most popular methods, e.g. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), electron microscopy (EM) and scanning probe microscopy (AFM and STM) will also be described. Furthermore, fundamental aspects of heterogeneous catalysis especially in connection with the future energy production will be analysed. All the above-mentioned methods will be discussed by use of a combination of lectures, exciting new research and application papers, and experiments followed by reports and oral presentations. A visit to the industry is also enclosed.",
