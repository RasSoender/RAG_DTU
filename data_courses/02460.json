Students are expected to have passed most of the machine learning courses offered by DTU Compute before attending this course. At a minimum, students are expected to have passed 02450: Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining and 02456: Deep Learning. Students will benefit most from the course if they have also passed 02476: Machine learning operations, 02477: Bayesian machine learning, and 02405 Probability Theory. The course can be followed in parallel with 02477.",
