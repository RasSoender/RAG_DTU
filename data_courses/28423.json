    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall purpose of the course is for the students to obtain knowledge of the most important thermodynamic principles, models and tools which are used in the industry. These models are available in the process simulators for calculating phase equilibria and other thermodynamic properties both at low and high pressures. The students will be able to use models for property estimation at various process conditions and for a wide range of compounds, from simple hydrocarbons, polar and hydrogen bonding compounds up to complex materials like polymers, electrolytes and pharmaceuticals. The calculated thermodynamic properties are of crucial importance in the petroleum, chemical and biochemical industries as well as for the design of chemical products and environmental assesments.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nChoose appropriate models for phase equilibrium calculations of different types of mixtures e.g. with non-polar, polar and associating compounds as well as mixtures with electrolytes and polymers at different conditions\nDescribe the most important \"common\" principles of many thermodynamic models (local compositions, corresponding states, regular solutions, group contributions, free volume) as well as their relationships\nUse the basic equations for various types of phase equilibria (VLE, LLE, SLE, VLLE, GLE, SGE,...) and estimate experimental activity coefficients from VLE or SLE data\nPerform phase equilibrium calculations for mixtures using thermodynamic models e.g. via suitable software as well as analyse the obtained results\nIdentify the most important intermolecular forces and based on them choose appropriate thermodynamic models for specific purposes and applications\nDescribe and analyse phase diagrams and choose appropriate models that could be used for their calculation\nDescribe the various methods for the estimation of both pure-component and mixture parameters in thermodynamic models (both equations of state and activity coefficient models)\nKnow the difference between correlative and predictive models\nUse the so-called EoS/GE mixing rules\nExplain the association principle and perform simple calculations with association models as well as predict the association schemes based on the structure of the compounds\nExplain the strengths and weaknesses of the various models and evaluate the capabilities of different models in describing various types of phase equilibria\nCalculate the distribution of chemicals in the environment (water-air-ground-living organisms) and present briefly models for biotechnology",
