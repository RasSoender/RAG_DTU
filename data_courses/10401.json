    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective is to give the students an understanding of the basic principles behind fusion energy and experimental plasma physics. The course will provide insight into plasma experiments and diagnostics required for the development of fusion energy. Acquired knowledge from this course provides a foundation for advanced studies of plasma physics at international plasma facilities and the local NORTH tokamak.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe basic properties of laboratory plasma used for fusion and ionospheric research\nIdentify breakdown methods for laboratory plasma\nApply MHD (magneto hydro dynamics) equations to obtain equilibrium states for magnetically confined plasma\nDescribe magnetic plasma confinement in toroidal devices: Tokamaks and Stellarators\nList passive diagnostics for low and high temperature plasma\nIdentify active diagnostics for core measurements in fusion plasma\nApply cold plasma theory to describe wave propagation in laboratory plasma\nDiscuss fundamental heating methods for magnetically confined plasma\nDesign basic plasma diagnostics for current, density, and temperature measurements\nDescribe the main sources and sinks of power in fusion plasmas\nConduct and analyse experiments on the NORTH tokamak at DTU",
    "Content": "Description of the fundamental processes of fusion energy and how they will be exploited. Conditions for ignition of fusion energy, i.e., the condition for producing more energy by the fusion processes than the input energy. Confinement of hot fusion-grade plasma. Magnetic confinement in toroidal devices: tokamaks and stellarators. Plasma equilibrium states in tokamaks. Basic instabilities in magnetically confined plasma. Wave propagation in fusion plasmas. Basic plasma heating schemes. Diagnostics of fusion plasma.",
