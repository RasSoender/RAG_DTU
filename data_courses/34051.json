    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with a good understanding of the physics of light-matter interaction in micro and nanostructures and the application to nanophotonic devices. Structuring of materials on a nanometer scale enables one to control the propagation and localization of light, e.g. by introducing defects in photonic crystals, and to tailor electronic states and optical transitions by use of quantum confinement effects in quantum wells and quantum dots. This basic control of materials properties is utilized to realize microlasers and nanolasers, but is also expected to form the basis for the development of new devices and technologies; e.g. optical devices with enhanced light-matter interaction for applications in information and quantum technology as well as sensors. Research topics at DTU Fotonik are incorporated and the course leads to theoretical as well as experimental special courses and master projects at DTU Fotonik.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the assumptions on which the various physical models are based\ndraft the derivation of the major results\naccount for the gain and spontaneous emission spectra in bulk, quantum well and quantum dot semiconductor materials\nformulate rate equations for semiconductor lasers and use these for analysing static and dynamic properties\ndescribe light-matter interaction as well as damping mechanisms on the basis of density matrix equations\naccount for Fermi’s Golden Rule as well as coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations\naccount for the basic theory and properties of photonic crystals and the use of defects for realizing waveguides and nanocavities\ndescribe the basic properties of metamaterials and plasmonic structures\ndescribe the use of the Green's tensor, local density of states and quasi-normal modes for characterizing the properties of structured electromagnetic materials\nanalyze and explain cavity QED (quantum electro-dynamical) effects involving the interaction between a two-level system and a photon, including vacuum Rabi oscillations and the Purcell effect\naccount for coupled-mode theory and its use",
