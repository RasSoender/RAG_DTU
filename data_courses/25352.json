This requires applying and combining expert knowledge in ocean engineering, fisheries, and / or aquaculture with innovation methods and business analysis tools.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze a business area in the blue bioeconomy and critically reflect on the challenges and developments.\nPerform an in-depth analysis of an innovation area and identify and evaluate business opportunities that address sustainability challenges.\nSelect appropriate methods to innovate a product, service, or experience.\nDefine and critically evaluate value propositions using methods in innovation and business development and demonstrate viability through prototyping.\nCreate different business models based on the market offer, the infrastructure needs, customer relationships, and financial viability and select the most suitable model.\nEstimate the market size for the value proposition and business model.\nList, compare, and prioritize suitable funding opportunities for the business’ future development and plan a path to profitability.\nCommunicate and defend the outcome of project work in a written report and oral presentation.",
    "Content": "The course is split equally into two phases. The first half of the course consists of an innovation phase in which students analyze a business area, identify, rank, and select solutions, and pitch the business idea. The second half of a business planning phase in which the value proposition and business model will be designed, refined, and presented. Both phases consist of lectures and group work and the methods presented in each session are applied immediately to work on a group project in the blue bioeconomy that addresses a sustainability challenge.\nStudents will choose a project based on predefined challenges and identify the business opportunities related to their challenge. Students will interview experts, potential customers, and business partners to support their work and develop their ideas. The feasibility and practicality of the value proposition (a product, service, or experience) will be demonstrated through prototyping.\nGuest speakers will provide context in areas such as sustainability and startup financing. The students will produce a mid-term pitch of the business idea followed by a report and oral presentation that communicates the value proposition and business model at the end of the course. The report and presentation are both weighted 50 % of the final grade and both parts must be passed (minimum 02) to pass the overall course.",
