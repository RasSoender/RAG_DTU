    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe and explain basic methods and concepts in test and design for test of integrated circuits (e.g. stuck-at faults, D-algorithm, built-in self-test)\nDescribe what a testable system implies and analyze, whether a digital circuit or parts hereof are testable\nanalyze smaller parts of a testable digital circuit, using well-known methods for test and design for test\nchoose and optimise the test resources that are useful under certain circumstances\ngiven a digital circuit, describe the circuits test properties (e.g., overhead, complexity) and suggest and compare different options to improve the test properties\ninvestigate a technical problem [based on an introduction] and communicate the results of the examination in a clear and precise manner, using a standard format for technical reports\nassess different methods to solve a selected technical problem and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages as solutions to the problem\nconstructively criticise a written report [on an academic problem], provide eventual missing parts in the report, and conclude on the entirety of the report\ndiscuss the methods presented [in technical papers] and relate these methods to similar findings, indicating similarities and differences",
    "Content": "The course treats the fundamental theory for test of electronic circuits with specific emphasis on the design of highly testable digital integrated circuits.\nThe course covers the topics of:\n- physical failure mechanisms and logic fault models,\n- testability analysis (controllability and observability),\n- algorithms for test pattern generation,\n- fault simulation (fault coverage),\n- design for test,\n- boundary scan techniques,\n- test planning in the design phase,\n- test systems.",
