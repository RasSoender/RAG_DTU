    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide knowledge and proficiency to understand and analyse how infrastructure, business development, and settlement patterns are connected in Arctic communities and landscapes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nClassify and discuss key aspects of infrastructure planning, and impact on society\nAnalyse socio-technical aspects and challenges regarding infrastructure including island operations\nExplain the consequences of mono-economic dependency and the correlation between settlement and business activities\nDiscuss environmental and social impact assessment (EIA and SIA) in relation to infrastructure projects\nAnalyse societal and environmental (sustainability) consequences of investments of different scales\nMap and analyse interests and actors related to infrastructure projects, and plan the stakeholder involvement\nOutline a strategy for sustainable development for a district or settlement with scenarios, analysis, creative processes and integration of diverse perspectives.\nCommunicate and interact professionally with other professionals, the political level and citizens",
    "Content": "The course introduces students to engineering work under Arctic conditions, and provides tools for understanding infrastructure and construction projects as sociotechnical processes. In the course, there is more focus on societal conditions and the changes that infrastructure projects entail than on construction technology. The course thus gives engineering students the opportunity to relate already acquired technical competencies to infrastructure projects in a specific Arctic context\n\nKey elements:\n- Social conditions in the Arctic\n- Socio-technical and social science approaches to infrastructure and society in the Arctic\n- Infrastructure and its importance for local development with links to global dynamics\n- Stakeholder and actor analyses\n- Sustainable local and regional development\n- Strategic planning\n- Logistics in the Arctic\n\nThe course will be based on group work; in each group there will be members with different backgrounds.\n\nThe course uses primarily local examples from Greenland, and will involve local actors. But examples from the Arctic region in general will also be included.\n\nThe competences obtained in this course will be of general value, since the focus is on developing adapted solutions based on local conditions.",
    "Remarks": "The course takes place in Sisimiut, Greenland\n\nThe course will normally be part of the Arctic Semester in Greenland together with 11857, 11859 and 11853 or 11854. Separate application for the semester to the department by 1 October.\n\nThe course can be taken as a stand-alone course under Open University.\n\nThe course could together with 11857 and 11859 be taken by Bachelor students in their last semester e.g. in combination with their Bachelor project.",
