    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course covers core topics in computer vision including 3D geometry and surface reconstruction for obtaining information from images obtained from a perspective camera. Computer vision methods are core to a range of applications including digital entertainment, mapping, visual sensors in industrial application, robot navigation, and many others. The course aims at providing students a combined theoretical and practical understanding of how computer vision problems are solved.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify relevant methods for solving computer vision problems.\nImplement a chosen computer vision algorithm in e.g. Matlab or Python.\nCarry out a systematic performance analysis of a computer vision algorithm.\nApply one and two view geometry for estimating points, positions, and surfaces.\nImplement and use linear methods for camera estimation.\nImplement and use camera calibration.\nImplement and apply the RANSAC algorithm.\nFind correspondences between 2D image points and estimate 3D points from these.\nUnderstand and use image features in computer vision.\nUse common computer vision software libraries.",
    "Content": "Methods covered in the course are based on a combination of mathematics, statistics and machine learning, all applied to images from a perspective camera. Students are introduced to theoretic aspects of computer vision methods and obtain practical experience by carrying out exercises, where the methods are implemented in computer programs. It is expected that students participating in this course have experience in programming in Python and experience with fundamental topics and concepts from image analysis.",
    "Course literature": "We will use lecture notes and scientific articles.",
