    "Academic prerequisites": "28344 or 27034 and 28345 , Fermentation technology knowledge and Bachelor in Chemistry & Technology Biotechnology or equivalent. For a successful participation in this course it is very important to have previous experience with microbial cultures. We expect you to have some previous experience with the following basic techniques (or a part of it): media preparation, sterilization in lab scale, inoculation, starting up and operating microbial cultivations in lab scale fermenters, sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. If you are not coming with the above described experience (or a part of it) it is better not to take the course.",

    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students hands-on experience with pilot-scale microbial cultivations and with a more profound and advanced perspective on industrial fermentation applications.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply fermentation technology and bioprocess theoretical knowledge on practical experimental problems\nPlan and implement fermentation experiments in pilot-scale\nSuggest strategies for monitoring of fermentation processes\nQuantitatively and qualitatively determine characteristics of a fermentation process\nEvaluate experimental data using simple mathematical models\nRelate experimental data to information found in scientific literature\nReflect on challenges in process efficiency related to operational parameters and scaling-up of bioprocesses\nReport and present findings and conclusions in a well-structured manner",
    "Content": "Students will plan and perform an open-ended, practical fermentation process exercise in groups. Based on considerate calculations on generated data combined with data found in scientific literature the students will evaluate and conclude on the performance of the fermentation process tested and discuss possible process optimization strategies. The course will also deal specifically with monitoring techniques and challenges in scaling-up of bioprocesses. The course will be focused on selected processes, which may include e.g. production of biofuels, biogas, baker´s yeast, enzymes and antibiotics. Both processes based on pure production cultures and processes based on microbial consortia may be considered. The group work will be summarized in a written report, which forms the basis for the oral examination.",
