    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the student the necessary background for general anisotropic elasticity theory with special attention to analyses of structures made of fibre reinforced composites. To give the student the background to dimension laminate structures with respect to stiffness and strength.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUse general anisotropic elasticity theory to calculate stresses and strains in Cartesian and in rotated coordinate systems\nCompute elastic properties for fibre composite materials\nAccount for and apply the basic methods within classical laminate theory\nAccount for the general relations between cross sectional forces and stresses for laminate plates\nUse plate differential equations with standard solutions to compute deflections of plates\nCompute progressive failure in fibre composites using state-of-art criteria\nCombine the classical theoretical design and analysis tools and develop a new calculation algorithm able to dimension specific fibre composite structures which do not fit into standard solutions\nEvaluate results achieved using standard or new developed design and analysis tools against an expected structural response",
    "Content": "The relation between stresses and strains in elastic anisotropic materials, together with rotational transformations of consitutive models are presented. Determination of elastic properties of composites. The necessary theory to analysis deflections, failure, stability and vibrations of fibre composite plates is presented. The course treats anisotropic materials like glass, carbon and aramid fibre reinforced polymers.\n\nThe course content is equally distributed between theoretical methods for analysis and the application of these methods in design based on criteria for stiffness and strength. Own computational tools are developed.",
