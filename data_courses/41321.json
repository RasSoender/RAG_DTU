    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nComplex flows are addressed using the fundamental flow equations combined with effects from surface tension, compressibility, heat and scalar transport and with multiphase phenomena. This includes properties of dispersed phase flow, particle size distribution, and particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions. The student will use the solutions and models on relevant engineering problems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDevelop algebraic relations and differential equations for complex flows from conservation principles and apply this on fluid problems\nDescribe and apply relations for exchange of heat and mass at a surface\nDescribe phenomena in compressible flows and compute one-dimensional compressible flow\nClassify and describe multiphase flows\nDescribe and solve dynamical relations for particles and droplets in a flow\nUse statistical relations to describe a population of particles, droplets or bubbles\nDescribe and apply models for particle-particle, particle-fluid and particle-wall interaction\nApply averaged equations for complex flow using differential equations and fluxes\nDescribe and model effects of surface tension in flows\nPresent a technical solution or model in a short and precise form",
    "Content": "One-dimensional compressible flows, analogy between momentum, heat and mass transfer, classification of multiphase flows, dynamical relations for particles and droplets, statistical description of particles, droplets or bubbles, models for particle-particle, particle-fluid og particle-wall interaction, averaged equations for multiphase flows. General experience in applying and developing models for complex flow situations.",
