    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nProduct/Service-Systems (PSS) is an approach to the design, development and operation of combinations of products and services, which offer new value to the end-user than in a traditional product development transactional paradigm. An important underlying concept behind PSS is that increased end-user value can be achieved, through more efficient utilisation of the engineered products and systems involved in value delivery. This course focuses on the different types of PSS solutions and approaches, the methods required to develop PSS solutions, the actions to be taken to ensure efficient operation of PSS solutions, the economical considerations and the sustainability opportunities related to PSS development and provision. A number of industry case studies will act as the case material for the course, which will be supported by academic articles, course material and worked exercises.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe what a product/service-system (PSS) is, in relation to a traditional product or service\nClassify PSS into the main types (e.g. product-oriented, use-oriented and result-oriented)\nDetermine the transition process from 'P' to ‘PSS’ in an organisation (also called servitisation)\nCompare development strategies for PSS in relation to products and services\nOptimise a PSS design, based on user value, total cost and environmental performance\nDevelop a PSS, by using a PSS development process\nSelect and apply a number of PSS development tools\nOptimise PSS operation, considering risk and contingency paths\nAnalyse and evaluate life cycle costing and potential of PSS solutions\nEvaluate the sustainability footprint and potential of PSS solutions",
    "Content": "Five main modules describe this course. The first module of the course focuses on an introduction to PSS, where the following subjects will be covered: PSS definition; the motivation for companies to adopt PSS; the different PSS typologies (e.g. product-oriented, use-oriented and result-oriented); and the differences and similarities of PSS in B2B, B2C and B2G contexts, respectively.\nThe second module of the course focuses on the actual design and development of PSS solutions, where the following subjects will be covered: PSS development processes; PSS design methods; PSS simulation during design; PSS integration into companies.\nThe third module of the course will focus on the economical and life cycle costing (LCC) considerations connected to PSS design and operation. In this module the following subjects will be covered: total cost of ownership (TCO); life cycle costing (LCC) models; cost-based assessment of PSS solutions.\nThe fourth and final module of the course will focus on the sustainability (combined environmental, social and business) considerations of PSS, where the following subjects will be covered: evaluation of life cycle environmental performance of PSS; PSS as an opportunity for a circular economy; environmental rebound effects.",
