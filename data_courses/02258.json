    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAll modern computer systems are parallel systems, whether they are\nembedded, server or distributed cloud system. In this course, you will\nstudy how these systems are designed and how to efficiently program\nthem.\n\nThe course assumes knowledge of, amongst other things, programming\nwith threads, processes and with system languages, in particular C.\nBased on this, you will explore how to use and implement modern\nparallel computing frameworks.\n\nYou will also study the system architecture of a wide range of\nparallel systems. The course will provide the insights needed to\nevaluate and design parallel systems, also at a low level.\n\nModern cloud systems and machine learning systems are parallel\ncomputers. This course will cover such system as well and will provide\nthe necessary insight to use but also design cloud and machine\nlearning systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain and derive analytic models for performance.\nevaluate the performance of parallel computer systems and applications.\nexplain fundamental design criteria for parallel computer systems.\nexplain what parts of the systems are critical for performance.\nexplain fundamental parallel programming paradigms.\noptimize a parallel application for a specific platform and programming paradigm.\ndesign simple parallel computer systems.\nimplement parallel programming frameworks.",
    "Content": "Computer systems: fundamental parallel computer architecture;\nmulti-core systems; scalable architectures; heterogeneous computer\narchitecture; cache and memory hierarchy effects; cache coherence;\nmemory models; cloud systems; machine learning hardware; performance\nanalysis.\n\nParallel programming: structured parallel programming; parallel\npatterns; implementation of synchronization primitives;\nimplementation of parallel programming frameworks;\n\nModeling: performance models; performance tools;",
