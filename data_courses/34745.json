    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims at providing analytical tools and methods for the design of linear control systems for MIMO (multi-input multi-ouptut) physical systems, based on the state space framework. The course also presents how the theoretical methods transpose into computer aided techniques for the practical design and implementation of the control systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify state variables of a single/multivariable dynamical system and formulate the corresponding nonlinear state space models\nCompute linear state space models from nonlinear ones and relate their behaviours close to/far away from the point of linearization\nAssess the system's static and dynamic properties and discuss their effects on the behaviour of the system's states and outputs\nDesign full state feedback controllers without/with integral action and compare the respective closed loop performances in relation to the design specifications\nDesign full/reduced order state estimators and appraise the behaviour of the estimation error\nSynthesize output feedback controllers and evaluate their performance in comparison to full state feedback controllers\nExplain simple stochastic processes and calculate the effect of noise propagation through a dynamical system\nDesign linear quadratic optimal feedback controllers and state estimators (Kalman filter) and evaluate the advantages/disadvantages of optimal solutions with respect to non-optimal ones\nSynthesize optimal output feedback controllers and evaluate their performance in comparison to non-optimal output feedback controllers\nAnalyse the closed loop system's performance and conclude about the level of adherence to the design specifications\nUse Matlab/Simulink as CAD tool for the analysis, design and simulation of dynamical systems",
