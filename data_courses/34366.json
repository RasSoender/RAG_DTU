    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to provide participants with the fundamental competences required to conceive, design and implement intelligent and distributed control systems combining data-driven and knowledge-based techniques. The course work offers participants an application-oriented introduction to machine learning and declarative methods of artificial intelligence. Course participants will learn the theoretical aspect of intelligent systems with respect to use-cases and top level design to design.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify a real-world problem and propose an intelligent system that can be used to help with this problem.\nIdentify and discuss situation awareness, decision, and control tasks in an intelligent system and identify the hardware and/or software requirements.\nDiscuss whether machine learning methods are applicable for a proposed intelligent system, and (if relevant) propose a suitable machine learning algorithm/method and evaluate its effectiveness.\nWork with a large data set, perform data exploration and feature extraction to derive knowledge from data in a real-world automation problem.\nExplain structured knowledge representation techniques and related modeling principles, and select suitable knowledge representations for integration in an intelligent systems solution.\nDescribe suitable uses of logic-based methods applied to the solution of decision making problems in intelligent systems.\nExplain and select appropriate methods as well as the corresponding data models and knowledge representations as part of a design problem.\nAnalyse an intelligent systems design problem, communicate the design idea, formulate specifications and test requirements.\nDesign operational prototype of an intelligent system using data-driven techniques applied to a distributed systems problem.\nWrite a project proposal for an intelligent system that is intended to solve a real-world problem and discuss how the functionality of the implementation can be tested and verified and how critical parts/elements can be identified.\nDiscuss the quality and availability of data for an intelligent system and how GDPR rules can affect the implementation or operation of an intelligent system.\nGive appropriate feedback on a project proposal",
