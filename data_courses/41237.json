    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe dynamic excitation of civil engineering structures often occurs due to environmental forces from wind, waves and earthquakes, or from traffic loading, collisions and explosions. The aim of this course is to provide an understanding of dynamic effects in large structures and enable students to perform dynamic analysis of structures with a single or multiple degrees of freedom, using analytical as well as numerical methods.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nFormulate the equation of motion for dynamic structures and systems.\nDetermine the solution for free and forced vibrations of systems with a single degree of freedom, and explain the meaning of a natural frequency, damping ratio and resonance.\nApply separation of variables and the finite element method to solve the equation of motion for vibrating beams.\nDetermine natural frequencies and vibration forms for systems with multiple degrees of freedom.\nApply modal analysis to compute the dynamic response of systems with multiple degrees of freedom.\nExplain quasi-static system reduction methods that minimize computational costs in dynamic analyses.\nUse Newmark-based time integration methods to compute the dynamic response of systems with multiple degrees of freedom.\nExplain the effect of the most common types of damping mechanisms.\nDesign the governing parameters of viscous dampers and tuned mass dampers (TMDs) on flexible structures.\nConduct a dynamic analysis and describe the results in written reports.",
    "Content": "The fundamental concepts of dynamics are introduced for simple systems with a single degree of freedom. Hereby, aspects such as natural frequencies, damping and resonance are introduced by determining the system’s free vibrations and its forced response to harmonic and transient loading.\n\nThe foundation of the dynamics of flexible structures is subsequently described by the theory for free beam vibrations, while the connection between this continuous element and its corresponding discrete structural model is illustrated by applying the finite element method to solve the partial differential equation. The dynamic analysis of discrete structures with multiple degrees of freedom is then conducted by modal analysis, based on a series representation by the vibration forms of the structure. Hereby, the influence of the load’s frequency content and its spatial distribution is considered, together with the potential of quasi-static system reduction techniques.\n\nFor flexible structures, the damping of the system is crucial for the magnitude of the dynamic response, why various naturally occurring damping mechanisms are scrutinized. Furthermore, the effect of external dampers on flexible structures is treated, including the use of tuned mass dampers. For flexible structures with local dampers or advanced loading, the dynamic equations are solved by direct time integration using the Newmark method.\n\nThe theoretical content of the course is illustrated by simple experiments and treated in exercises, which can be solved in Python. The reports constitute a part of the total course assessment. The first report is handed in individually, while the subsequent two reports are prepared in groups.",
