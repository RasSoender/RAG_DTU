    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide students with basic knowledge of the technology used in recirculating aquaculture systems. The course should enable students to describe the design and functional properties of individual components used in aquaculture with a high degree of water reuse.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the mechanical, physical, biological and chemical processes and components used in a recirculating aquaculture facility.\nCalculate the required dimensions of the central treatment components in a recirculation facility.\nAccount for the fundamental processes in biological filtration\nAccount for the function and theoretical background of the techniques used in water oxygenation and degassing\nAccount for processes and methods used for removal of particles\nAccount for sources and composition of nutrients in wastewater from aquaculture\nAccount for methods to reduce nutrient loading from production in aquaculture\n-",
    "Content": "Central technology and processes in recirculating systems and the functional properties of working components. Water supply and quality, nutrient loading, particle removal. Operational conditions. Nitrification processes and biofilter design. Denitrification processes. Chemical disinfection, UV and ozone treatment. Oxygenation and degassing. Dimensioning of central components.",
    "Remarks": "We highly recommend taking 25331 and 25316 in the same semester.\nThis course provides students with competences relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #2 (Zero hunger), #12 (Responsible consumption and production) and #14 (Life below water)",
