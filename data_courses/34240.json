    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the participants solid knowledge of the basic principles of data science and compression and methods for data compression e.g. for image communication. To enable the students to implement and evaluate data analysis and compression algorithms.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nimplement a data compression or analysis scheme\nsimulate data compression encoding and decoding\ncalculate and evaluate the performance factor\ncalculate and evaluate the quality of decoded or reconstructed data objectively and subjectively\nanalyse and explain an entropy estimate, e.g in relation to a code length\nexplain decorrelation of data for analysis and compression\nexplain quantization of a data representation\nexplain the entropy concept, e.g. for coding",
    "Content": "Introduction to the basic principles and methods for data science and compression incl. basics of information theory as entropy, cross entropy and mutual information (MI). The entropy is a measure of information and mutual information a measure of shared information. This includes entropy coding by Huffman and arithmetic coding, decorrelation by prediction or transformation to the frequency domain and quantization of data for lossy coding and representation.\nSome examples of data for compression and analysis are presented, eg. coding and analysis of: Data strings, Images in the frequency domain (DCT and wavelets - JPEG image coding specifications), Audio signals, and video as image sequences. Application areas include coding and analysis of images, video and data from drones, as well as high-quality images, e.g. for internet applications.\nMidway, the students choose a project within the areas presented.",
