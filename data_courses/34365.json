    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective for this course is to give the students the opportunity to develop a prototype based on a product idea within Internet of Things. The course focusses on low-power WAN technologies, IoT backend solutions, but also on the product and business side of a potential IoT product",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify the challenges the market has for IoT products (technology push or pull)\nAnalyse low power WAN technologies for different product use cases\nApply design thinking principles\nSynthesize a prototype fulfilling a specific market need\nPerform a market analysis\nIncorporate UX design parameters\nApply basic electronics principles and circuitry\nDevise software and applications\nApply 3D design, printing, circuit design, prototype manufacturing principles\nDescribe start-up funding opportunities\nWrite a technical report and present the prototype at a pitch-style presentation",
    "Content": "The focus of the course will be on applying IoT technologies in a specific prototype. The course is based on hands-on project work and prototyping. Topics covered include market research and analysis, design thinking, low-power communication technologies, basic electronics, 3D design, Arduino & microcontroller programming, UX design, APP design, start-up funding opportunities, report writing and pitching, guest lectures from industry and other DTU departments. Students are expected to be knowledgeable of Arduino or C/C++ programming and wireless communication technologies to a level taught in 34315, 34338 or 34346. Students are expected buy their own IoT kit (approx. kr. 300-400.-), but no expenses for books (the same kit as used in 34315, 34338, 34346). Being present in class for mandatory exercises and group work is an integral part of the course. The evaluation will consist of assignments, giving peer feedback, reports and an oral presentation to the class on the last day of the course.",
