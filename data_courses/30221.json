    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo complete a project, preferably in a group, where an open problem is solved, in which a combination of skills and competencies obtained through the normative competence courses (30202 and 30230) are used. Teamwork is strongly encouraged.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe, design, construct, validate and choose solutions in the form of monitoring, mapping or exploration systems or parts hereof by combining measurement technologies with an understanding of physical processes and structures\nfind and select relevant literature and additional information from researchers working in relevant fields\nanalyse a heteorogeneous problem and formulate a precise requirements specification for the task to be solved\nperform problem, design and implementation oriented analyses and discuss advantages and disadvantages for alternative solutions\nmake a plan for how a task can be solved on time with the available ressources\nexplore and analyze relevant technologies for solving the given problem\nsubstantiate the choice of technologies on the basis of clearly formulated premises\ncarry the project through with great independence in all aspects\ninterpret, judge and sum up the results, and present results by means of suitable figures, graphs and tables\nwrite a well-structured and well-documented report that presents results and analyses in a precise and clear way.",
    "Content": "This is a project-based course where (a group of) students work on a topic related to an ongoing R&D project. The format is based on a research immersion course work carried out in the department/lab and not in the classroom. The work to be carried out can be data analysis, participation in experimental work, field exercises, etc. The learning outcomes are achieved by ‘learning by doing’.\nThe exact project and theme will be agreed upon between the student(s) and a supervisor chosen by the students in connection with the enrollment.",
    "Remarks": "The course is a framework course mandatory for the students in the master programme Earth & Space Physics and Engineering, to enable them to fulfil the general competence requirements of the programme.\nPhD students and postdocs can be (co)supervisors.\nStudents will be able to perform projects at other institutes after approval of the project+supervisor by the head of ESPE master's studies.",
