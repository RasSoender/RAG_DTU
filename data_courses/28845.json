    "Evaluation": "pass / not pass , internal examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "(28140/28342).­(28016/28160) , A basic course in chemical reaction engineering, such as is part of a bachelor program in chemical engineering, and a basic course in mathematical modelling. Reports should be written using Word or some other text editing software. Data treatment and analysis involves use of spreadsheets and mathematical simulation software (fx. Excel and Maple/Matlab/Python). See Remarks.",
    "Participants restrictions": "Maximum: 21",

    "Department": "28 Department of Chemical Engineering",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo illustrate the theory taught in a basic chemical reaction engineering course (such as 28140 Introduction to Chemical Reaction Engineering or 28342 Chemical Reaction Engineering) by experimental exercises with accompanying calculations and simulations.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPlan short series of experiments in lab reactors with the intent of satisfying preset goals.\nAnalyze reactor models in order to be able to compare model predictions with experimental evidence.\nModify standard models for simple chemical reactors to get agreement between model description and experimental conditions.\nCombine standard models for simple chemical reactors to a model for the behaviour of non-ideal lab reactors.\nCharacterize lab reactors through residence time distributions (measured or model based).\nCalculate upper and lower limits for conversion based on knowledge of residence time distributions.\nProcess experimental data in spreadsheets to carry out data analysis, reactor simulation, and graphical representation of data and computational results.\nCompare measured data with reactor calculations carried out through use of simulation software such as Maple or Matlab.\nJudge the accuracy of experimental data, and explain deviations from theoretical predictions.\nCollect the descriptions of exercise planning, execution, results and comparison with theory in well structured reports.",
    "Content": "The operation of chemical and catalytic reactors are investigated experimentally: the dynamic startup of an adiabatic tank reactor, residence time distribution, multiple steady states, operation of a catalytic fixed bed reactor. The experimental results are analysed on the basis of theory taught in the introductory course in chemical reaction engineering. Models for the dynamic approach to steady state are developed and implemented in numerical solvers. Application of programs like Excel and Maple/Matlab/Python is an integrated part of the course (see Qualified Prerequisites and Remarks).",
    "Remarks": "Students in the MSc Chemical and Biochemical Engineering program have preferential access.\n\nStudents who cannot use spreadsheets and simulation software as specified in the qualified prerequisites will be dropped from the course by the instructor.",
