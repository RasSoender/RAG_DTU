    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main goal of the course is to provide the students with an understanding and a portfolio of actionable tools (techniques) for the optimization of manufacturing processes.\nThe achievement of the objective is based on acquisition of data (both experimental and simulation) and the corresponding analytics to extract knowledge from those data.\nSpecifically, the course will integrate three main domains of data, analytics, and digital manufacturing:\n(1) Multi-physics process simulation (model-driven simulation, e.g., finite element methods, computational fluid dynamics as well analytical solutions from simplified systems).\n(2) Statistical modelling (data-driven simulation, e.g., design of experiments, multivariate analysis, machine learning).\n(3) Digital twin technology (integration of physical data and simulative data).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the most important approaches and methods used within digitalization of manufacturing processes and production.\nManage and analyze data (both off-line and in-line) generated during manufacturing to extract insight and valuable information for effective decision making cross the entire data value chain including: (i) Data pre-setting; (ii) Data processing; (iii) Data post-process; (iv) Data quality.\nIdentify and apply the most relevant 1st principles-based modelling techniques for the simulation and optimization of a given manufacturing process.\nIdentify and apply the most relevant data-driven modelling techniques for the simulation and optimization of a given manufacturing process.\nExplain product/process causalities and correlations based on (a) materials science and material behavior understanding; (b) manufacturing knowledge; (c) data analytics.\nDistinguish and discuss the differences between 'correlation' and 'causality'.\nRecommend optimization strategies to improve the performance of single manufacturing processes as well as process chains based on experimental and simulative data.\nUse Reduced Order Models (ROMs).",
