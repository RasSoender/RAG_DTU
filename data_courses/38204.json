    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course students will learn the skills and techniques of deciding whether a business idea is worth the investment in time and money needed to get it off the ground. In lectures, exercises and group work the students gradually learn how to perform feasibility studies. Throughout the course, students work on two real-life cases, for which they elaborate a comprehensive feasibility report and present their work to external examiners. The business ideas can derive from students, companies, DTU technology or (societal) challenges. Within these two different projects, students will actively perform feasibility studies in different team constellations. The teams will look at the evidence of need and customer development, potential market size, technical feasibility and constraints, cost of development and the availability of funding to both initiate the project and to keep it going. As the projects centre around sustainable solutions, students will actively integrate sustainability indicators and ethical considerations that can provide supplementary information with regard to the opportunities and risks involved in a business idea.\nThe course shall prepare MSc Technology Entrepreneurship students to decide on a project and team to work on throughout the rest of their studies. It will also prepare them to navigate in a professional work environment that demands skills in both engineering and economics, e.g. as in business development or project management.\n\nMost of the work will happen outside the classroom and will be done in groups. The groups will be formed by the course responsible based on students' own priorities, with an emphasis on group heterogeneity.",
