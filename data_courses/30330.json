    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course's primary focus is on hardware/software interaction and the development and application of electro-optical systems. Emphasis is on optimal hardware performance, i.e. optics, camera, acquisition HW, in application in surveillance, navigation, medicine and industrial control.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndesign a stand alone image analysis system\noptimize the electro optical front-end\nresearch and design an adequate algorithm for the basic measurement problem\nperform an exhaustsive scene analysis\nperform an adequate noise source analysis\ndesign and implement a digital version of the algorithm\nperform the relevant Software/Hardware analysis\nimplement and verify the selected analysis algorithm\nplan, implement and evaluate a verification of the selected method\nevaluate the actually implemented method(s) against alternative solutions.",
    "Content": "In the first 10 weeks, the principle of image formation in optical systems and the physics of photoabsorption and electron transport in semiconductors (with emphasis on CCD and APS technology). The students will also be introduced to analogue and digital processing of electronic image information and the use and optimal use of SW libraries.\n\nIn the last part of the course, the focus is on applying and embedding image analysis in real-world applications. Examples of fields addressed are object classification and recognition applied in vision-based navigation in 2D and 3D scenes and automatic detection and recognition of targets. Throughout, the focus is on usability through robustness and autonomy.",
