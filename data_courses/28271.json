    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThere is an urgent need to develop efficient and sustainable energy technologies that can utilize the limited amount of available biomass and wastes. Thermal gasification and pyrolysis are promising technologies that can increase the conversion efficiency of biomass, including several difficult low-value fuels, from a variety of sectors in the society, by producing e.g. power and district heating, biochar and/or biofuels. The course will provide a hands-on approach and an overview to the processes and products of thermal gasification and pyrolysis of biomass by including pilot-scale experimental exercises followed by chemical characterization of the products. This will enable the students to evaluate and assess complex aspects of sustainability in connection to production of bioenergy and associated technical challenges – including handling and characterization of biomass resources, stepwise thermal conversion and utilization of resulting biochar as soil-improving product in future farming systems and as a mean for CCS - carbon capture and storage.\nThe students will also be presented with the current research activities in the research group and be introduced to the main challenges associated with pyrolysis, gasification and sustainability aspects of biomass today.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAssess the potential and sustainability of selected biomass resources\nClarify the principles of pyrolysis and gasification processes and the most important technical challenges\nPerform mass and energy balances for pyrolysis and gasification processes\nUnderstand the effect of the most important fuel properties and their effect on the gasification and pyrolysis process\nCarry out simple thermal conversion processes\nCharacterize products of biomass pyrolysis and gasification, including biochar, producer gas, bio-oil and its potential as biofuel\nDescribe the potential applications for the products of pyrolysis and gasification, and their role in a circular bioeconomy\nPresent and discuss results obtained in experimental exercises",
    "Content": "The course will be structured in three main parts:\n− Biomass resources sustainability and characterization\n− Theory and practice of pyrolysis and gasification\n− Analysis of products and reporting of results\n\nThe biomass resource and characterization part focuses on biomass as a renewable energy source and its different conversion paths for energy applications. Moreover, challenges that occur during thermal biomass conversion will be discussed.\n\nThe theory behind gasification and pyrolysis processes will be covered in the lectures, as well as an overview on the state-of-the art technologies. Experimental runs of pyrolysis and gasification reactors at Risø will provide a practical example of such processes. Simple calculations of mass balance and energy balances for selected processes will be carried out.\n\nThe products, such as biochar, bio-oil and gas and their characterization methods will be introduced and the students will apply these in the experimental work in the laboratory, including elemental analysis, GC and GC-MS analysis, Karl-Fisher titration, BET analysis.\n\nEnough time will be given during the course to work on the report of lab experiments results. In addition, students will have to complete a final exam focused on the contents of the course lectures, especially technology fundamentals and applications of pyrolysis and gasification technologies and products.",
