    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course Applied Photovoltaics is a laboratory course that provides hands on experience in photovoltaic (PV) module fabrication and characterization. The student will be presented with the theory behind the most commonly used PV characterization methods in PV research and industry. Hands on characterization of PV devices and PV power electronic converters will be performed in the lab and in the field, including measurements of the device’s electrical, thermal, and optical characteristics. Furthermore, the student will perform three different PV imaging techniques and will be able to differentiate each technique with its distinctive advantages when analyzing PV failures. Some of these characterizations and imaging techniques will be performed on a mini PV module that is designed and built by the students themselves. Moreover, the student will also be acquainted with techniques for measuring the solar resource, shading at the site and analyzing PV-plant performance data.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe in detail the steps required to manufacture crystalline silicon PV modules\nDesign and fabricate a PV module\nExplain the effect the irradiance have on the I-V curves of PV devices\nExplain the effect the temperature have on the I-V curves of PV devices\nExplain the effect that the incident angle of sunlight has on transmission and reflection\nDescribe the principles behind thermography, electroluminescence and photoluminescence imaging and describe the unique advantages that each technique has when diagnosing PV failures\nCharacterize and describe the efficiency parameters and test procedures of a PV power converter\nAnalyze field performance of a PV system",
    "Content": "The course will present the theory behind the most commonly used PV characterization and imaging methods. The course will also provide lectures that describe in detail how crystalline silicon modules are fabricated. These lectures will be followed by lab exercises where all students will perform various electrical, thermal and optical PV characterization techniques, and also build their own mini-module. The course will conclude with group work on laboratory assignments, and the students will present their results in an oral presentation, and participate in an informal “create the best module competition”.",
