    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objectives of this course are to learn how to formulate, implement, and assess models of life in the aquatic environments. The course combines hands-on experience with developing own models and using existing professional tools.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nConfidently formulate new ecological models or sub-models.\nSolve partial differential equations representing the processes of advection and diffusion using basic finite-difference numerical algorithms.\nDescribe and model basic processes relevant for constructing box-type Nutrients-Plankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (NPZD) models.\nDesign, parameterize, implement, operate, and interpret results of a NPZD model of a water column.\nBe confident in converting between different units in equations and parameters.\nDiscuss strengths and weaknesses of NPZD types of models for predicting production in the water column, e.g. spring and autumn blooms and sub-surface production maxima.\nHave knowledge of the Mike-Ecolab modelling system.\n-",
    "Content": "Computational Ecology focuses on advanced ecological models solved by numerical solutions of partial differential models.\n\nThe students develop a 1D hydrographic model for a water column driven by the seasonal cycle of wind and temperature, including the nutrient, plankton, zooplankton, and detritus cycle (NPZD model). This involves acquiring the basic theory for solving partial differential equations numerically. The model will be used to simulate the seasonal cycle of the hydrography and primary/secondary production.\n\nThe second part of the course involves application of existing advanced model system: the Mike EcoLab system from DHI. Finally, the students develop their own project, which could either involve extending one of the developed models, e.g. applying it to a specific situation, developing a new ecological model platform, or apply existing professional ecological modelling tools, e.g. to use DHIs EcoLab for a practical problem.",
