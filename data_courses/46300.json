    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give a general introduction to the aerodynamics and elastic behaviour of a modern wind turbine. Further, the placement of wind turbines is addressed. Also, the elastic blade response with the aerodynamic loads is addressed.\nIn addition, students will learn basics of Electrical Power Engineering including circuit theory, introduction to relevant components (generators, transformers, cables...) and wind electric energy system. Economical as well as political issues related to wind energy will be introduced.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine airfoil data\nCompute induced velocities\nDevelop a computer code to calculate aerodynamic loads\nCalculate internal loads and the static deformation of a loaded wind turbine blade\nCompute the eigenmodes and associated eigenfrequencies for a wind turbine blade\nDraw velocity triangle incl. induced velocities\nDetermine annual energy production for a wind turbine\nUnderstand and be able to solve electric DC and AC circuits using Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws\nUnderstand and be able to quantify the relevant component's operation with equivalent circuits\nUnderstand and be able to quantify the components interaction as a part of the system in modern wind energy\nCalculate active and reactive power in AC circuits\nCalculate loads and energy production for a vertical axis wind turbine",
