    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of this course is to provide an understanding of the methods and analyses that form the basics of both performance monitoring (fuel efficiency) and decision support (safety) with regards to ship operations during sailing in a seaway. These techniques are used by naval architects and engineers in the technical departments of ship owners, in classification societies, and ship consultancies.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the purpose and principles of decision support systems for navigational and operational guidance of ships\ncarry out time series simulations of ship responses\ndescribe how wave energy spectra and/or sea state parameters can be obtained and subsequently applied in analyses\napply Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to measured time series of ship responses\ncompute prediction of wave-induced statistics of responses\nexplain how the fuel efficiency of a merchant fleet is influenced by different factors\nexplain how human factors are affecting ship operations during sailing\ncompute fatigue damage in the hull girder of a ship on the basis of recorded values of the bending moment in the hull girder\ndescribe, prepare and discuss results derived from the analysis of full-scale as well as simulated response data",
    "Content": "The term ‘ship operations’ covers in its general use a wide field of disciplines within shipping and naval architecture. In this course, the term is restricted specifically to aspects dealing with a ship sailing in a seaway on open oceans, where the main problem relates to wave excitations of the ship (including motions, loads and fuel consumption). In particular, the focus is on performance monitoring and decision support systems, used to, respectively, monitor fuel efficiency (retrospectively) and guide crew in decisions focused on safety on-board the ship (in real-time). The course deals with a variety of topics, including seakeeping, human factors affecting ship operations, EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index), full-scale measurements, stochastic waves, ocean wave energy spectra, motion transfer functions.",
    "Remarks": "The course includes project work and reading of scientific papers.",
