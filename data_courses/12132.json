    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course objective is to make the student competent in assessment of waste management systems and waste technologies with regard to mass-flow, environmental loads and savings, and resource use and recovery using a life-cycle perspective. The student will be able to model waste management systems, perform uncertainty analysis, make general conclusions from model results, and prepare communicable summaries of main characteristics of selected waste management systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the need for a life-cycle perspective on waste management\nDescribe advantages and disadvantages of using LCA models on waste management systems\nExplain the general principles in calculating environmental loads/savings as well as resource use/recovery\nExplain the principles in LCA modeling of waste management technologies (collection, sorting, incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting, landfilling, recycling and energy utilization)\nCreate and evaluate LCA models on waste management systems and waste technologies\nDiscuss the importance of assumptions and boundary conditions in LCA modeling of waste management systems\nAnalyze uncertainties and limitations in LCA of waste system modeling\nInterpret results from LCA modeling of complex waste management systems\nSummarize in general technical terms advantages and disadvantages of waste management systems from an LCA approach",
    "Content": "Modeling approach to waste quantities, waste composition, collection, transport, source separation, mechanical sorting, incineration, composting, anaerobic digestion, landfilling, energy utilization, material recycling and material utilization. Brief summary of approach and methods in LCA. Introduction to the EASETECH model. Hand-on assignments in using EASETECH. Definition of waste management systems. Modeling of waste management systems. Interpretation of results, uncertainty analysis and communication of results.",
