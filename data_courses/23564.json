    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThat the students acquire competences in the part of food product development, which is concerned with food product design and the food product technology associated with that. This would typically be the tasks that product developers would be assigned in a product development laboratory in the food industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse a complex task assignment and plan its completion and deliverables.\nDevelop and design a plausible product concept, including relevant alternatives.\nDescribe advantages and disadvantages of relevant packaging materials and packaging design in relation to transport, storage and sales.\nInvestigate and acquire relevant business and market information, including the end-user (consumer).\nCalculate variable and fixed costs associated with a new product.\nIdentify important technological challenges and suggest solutions.\nIdentify suitable analytical procedures for production control.\nuse Artificial Intelligence (AI) for building your buisness case and to support the food product innovation\nDemonstrate and report overview and in-depth solutions to the task assignment with respect to both technological and commercial challenges.\nBe able to prepare a manuscript meeting a specific format defined by a journal selected for publishing. This includes proper use and citation of relevant literature.",
    "Content": "The course is carried out as group work in teams of 3 students (optional 2 or 4 students). Each team will work on a specific product development task.\nEach team will decide about the target for a novel food product to develop. The targets and the teams will be defined through brain storming sessions during the first weeks of the course. Students are advised to consider and propose ideas for novel food products to work on during the course.\nStage gate project management will be introduced and applied on the work of the project teams.\nSubjects of specific relevance for food product development will be introduced by lectures given by invited experts from industry and DTU. These subjects are likely to cover sensoric analysis, consumer analysis, life cycle analysis, sustainability, process economy, packaging, food ingredients, and industrial project management.\nEach team must prepare a prototype of the food product and the team prepares a report describing the key issues for the product. The key issues will include: target market, consumer acceptability, production process, product quality, cost calculation, product pricing, way of distribution etc.\nThe report will be prepared in the format of a manuscript for a scientific food journal or a conference proceeding.\nThe progress during the course will be monitored through two stage/gate meetings.\nThe final assessment is based on the report, an oral group presentation, and an individual oral exam.",
