    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nExperimentation in cognitive science is a young field, and many mysteries remain about human behaviour, perception, and performance. With the ever-growing amount of human data available, and development of data science and artificial intelligence, it is a crucial time for understanding how to collect, handle, and interpret human data.\n\nThis course will teach engineering students how to formulate research questions and testable hypotheses in cognitive science, use them to carry out appropriate experiments by collecting behavioural and/or physiological data from human participants, and interpret the results of their experiments in the context of a wider research question within cognitive science.\n\nExperiments will be conducted at the CogSys BioLab lab, in the classroom, or online in groups of 2-3. The course is limited to 50 students.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe ethical considerations when conducting experiments with human participants\nDescribe different behavioural (i.e. reaction time, eye-tracking) and physiological (i.e. heart rate, HRV) measures in cognitive science, and how they can inform human cognition\nUse AI to zoom into a research field of interest, within the field of cognitive science\nFind, assess, and review relevant literature in a chosen field of cognitive science\nFormulate a research question and testable hypothesis in cognitive science research\nDesign an experiment in cognitive science to test a given hypothesis\nPerform an experiment to test the hypothesis by collecting behavioural or physiological data from human participants\nAnalyze the experiment by pre-processing the data and applying appropriate statistical analyses\nReport the results of the experiment, and interpret them in the context of a wider research area",
    "Content": "This course introduces experimentation in cognitive science, and teaches engineering students how to collect, handle, and interpret human data in an ethically considerate manner.\n\nCore elements:\n- Ethics and data handling in experimentation with human participants\n- Behavioural and physiological measures in cognitive science\n- Experimental design and analysis principles in cognitive science",
