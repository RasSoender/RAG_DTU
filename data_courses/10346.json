    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give the student a basic understanding of the physics of spatially extended media consisting of solid materials, liquids, and gasses. The course can be regarded as a natural extension of classical mechanics (including thermodynamics/statistical mechanics) or be the basis for more specialized studies in elasticity, hydrodynamics, microfluidics, biophysics, and complex systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the theory of hydrostatic equilibrium, including pressure, buoyancy, stability of a floating object, hydrostatic shapes and surface tension.\nExplain the concepts of strain and stress in elastic materials and explain the derivation of and apply the Cauchy equation and Hooke’s law.\nExplain the derivation of and apply the Euler, the Bernouilli, the Navier-Stokes, and the continuity equation for incompressible fluid flows.\nDescribe flows at low Reynolds number.\nDerive the wave equation and the dispersion relation for linear surface waves and sound waves in fluid- and elastodynamic systems\nApply linear stability theory and explain the Rayleigh-Plateau instability.\nExplain and apply Prandtl’s boundary layer equations.\nApply dimensional analysis to make estimates in continuum physics.\nSolve analytic problems from selected models in continuum physics.\nApply vector and tensor analysis with the index notation on models in continuum physics",
    "Content": "Introduction of velocity field and pressure field. Hydrostatic problems with special focus on surface tension. Strain and stress in elastic media. The equations for linear elasticity. Bending and buckling. Ideal, incompressible fluid motion (the Euler equation). Viscosity, Navier-Stokes equation, and boundary layers. Potential flow theory, surface waves and sound waves in fluid- and elastodynamic materials. Index notation in vector and tensor analysis.",
