    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course is to illustrate the theories as taught in the introductory course 28216 – Organic Coatings Science and Technology by laboratory experimental exercises and field exposure testing and inspection. By offering the hands-on experience on (small-scale) coating production, coating application and testing, it is further aimed at training the students to be able to facilitate the provision of more sustainable coating solutions to the industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nOperate the relevant equipment for production, application, exposure and testing of coatings.\nSelect raw materials and formulate simple coating systems.\nProduce the as-formulated coating and control the quality.\nPrepare the surface to be coated.\nApply coatings on the substrate.\nSelect relevant coatings standards and test protocols.\nEvaluate coating performance.\nConduct field inspections.",
    "Content": "The practical exercises consist of seven exercises, including laboratory experiments in coating formulation, coating production, coating application, coating testing, including testing of physical, mechanical and chemical properties of coatings, such as dry film thickness, adhesion, hardness and anti-corrosive performance, etc. and field exposure and inspection at the CoaST Maritime Test Center (CMTC) in Hundested, Denmark.",
