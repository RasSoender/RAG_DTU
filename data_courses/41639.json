    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course applies interdisciplinary engineering systems design and systems engineering principles to the design and re-design of socio-technical systems. The course emphasises systems thinking, systems analysis, systems architecture and systems design to address technical, social, organisational, and policy requirements; in connection also to UN's sustainable development goals. The socio-technical systems in focus are manifold and may range from a hospital ward, inter-company collaborations, eldercare, to examples such as major infrastructure investments (e.g. multimodal transportation networks, energy generation and distribution systems, or integrated aerospace systems). As part of the course, the students will design/re-design a socio-technical engineering system.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse socio-technical engineering systems and select relevant perspectives\nDefine and model socio-technical engineering systems\nArticulate multi-dimensional requirements of engineering systems\nPerform analyses to identify requirement conflicts and define possible design solutions\nSynthesise design ideas and concepts\nAnalyse and re-design existing systems in order to optimise and improve selected attributes\nExplain the practical, complex execution of system-level design processes and the students own role within these processes\nCreate and communicate design solutions\nArgue for the application of the design solution within context\nProvide reflected criticism of others' design processes and results\nCritically evaluate, select and use AI tools to increase productivity of engineering design processes\nCarry out a team design project and define own team role",
    "Content": "Project work focuses on the development of a socio-technical engineering system. This includes technical, service, organisational, process and policy aspects and overall system integration.\n\nThe project should cover the following aspects:\n\n- system-oriented analysis of the current state\n- definition of multi-dimensional requirements from a technical, service, organisational and policy perspective and analysis & discussion of requirement conflicts\n- interdisciplinary design and product development processes initiated according to an enterprise or client's strategies and objectives, using the clients knowledge and competencies\n- exploration of design alternatives based on advanced domain knowledge\n- simulation or pilot implementation of proposed design solution\n- customization of design process and reflection on your role as a designer",
