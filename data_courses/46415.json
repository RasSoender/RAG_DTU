    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nOptimal design workflows are increasingly being used in the design of advanced, high performance and lightweight components and structures. Examples include wind turbines, airplanes, land vehicles, marine and space vehicles. Numerical optimization algorithms are routinely employed for determining the optimal combination of geometry, material properties and topology that maximize the performance of various components.\n\nThe course will provide the student with experience on how to apply numerical design optimization for component design problems within wind energy. The student will have the option to explore rotor composite structural design, rotor aerodynamic design or wind turbine steel support structure design. Analysis code for each of these problems will be given. The experience is also relevant for the design of a general class of other complex components and structures.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nFormulate an optimal design problem, i.e., identify the design variables and corresponding parameterization technique, choose suitable constraints and objective functions\nPerform sensitivity analysis of the proposed problems\nEstimate the optimal configuration of a wind turbine rotor blade or support structure, using some simplifying assumptions and basic load cases\nComputing critical constraints for design problems\nNumerically solve aerodynamic/structural optimization problems and conduct sensitivity analysis using specific optimization algorithms and techniques\nCarry out relevant engineering design studies using numerically optimization\nInterpret and analyze the results from the optimization process\nWrite technical reports describing the work carried out throughout the course",
    "Content": "The course is focused on the practical application of numerical optimization to solve common wind turbine design problems. However, much of the content is still relevant for other fields. The course will feature lectures of the following topics:\n\n- Components optimization with focus on relevant problem formulations.\n- Optimization theory and algorithms for nonlinear optimization.\n- A brief review of aerodynamic and structural analysis methods, using methods typically used in industrial design\n- Overview of the iterative process underlying the design optimization of wind turbine components.\n- Determination of the design driving constraints and its relation with the different phenomena observed in wind turbine components.\n\nThe course is structured around 3 projects, students will have the option to focus on 1 of 3 design problems:\n\n1) Wind Turbine Rotor Composite Structural Design.\n2) Wind Turbine Rotor Aerodynamic Design.\n3) Wind turbine steel offshore support structure design.\n\nFollowing approval from the course responsible students will have the option to tackle their own design optimization project for the final project.",
