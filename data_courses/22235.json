    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of the course is to give students an insight into drug delivery using nanocarriers (i.e. nanodrugs), which are increasingly used in healthcare. The course is focused on understanding the design principles behind drug loaded nanocarriers from the perspective of the materials used and the physiological challenges that have to be overcome.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the fundamental design principles behind drug loaded lipidic and polymeric nanocarrriers.\ndescribe the fundamental biological barriers to drug delivery.\ndescribe biology-nanocarrier-drug dynamics.\nanalyse drug delivery research publications to compare and contrast nanocarrier based strategies to drug delivery.\nanalyse advanced targeting and release strategies, through compare and contrast, to overcome biological barriers.\nevaluate drug delivery research publications to critique nanocarrier based strategies and select appropriate strategies for human disease treatment.\nevaluate the potential of advanced tissue targeting and controlled release strategies for human disease treatment.\ndesign a new nanocarrier based strategy through the selection of appropriate drugs and nanocarrier physicochemical properties to overcome biological barriers and treat a specific disease.",
    "Content": "The development of advanced drug loaded nanocarriers that can deliver drugs in a targeted manner to diseased tissues, increase drug uptake and transport drugs across biological barriers is becoming increasingly important for the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare. 22235 is mainly focused on the chemcical aspects of how lipidic and polymeric nanocarriers can be designed to improve efficacy and how these nanodrugs interact with the biological milieu, ranging from serum proteins to organs. 22235 will introduce a range of therapeutics (pharmaco, biologic and gene) along with the lipidic and polymeric carrier chemistry. Research articles in nanocarrier based drug delivery will be used as a method to introduce strategies and fundamental concepts in this research field. This will introduce both cutting edge and historical aspects of the field allowing students to understand design principles. Students will analyse and evaluate these design principles. Lecture slides/videos will be used to introduce and/or reaffirm basic concepts in drug delivery. Ultimately in the project component students will design a new nanocarrier based strategy for a disease of their choice.",
    "Course literature": "Peer-reviewed research and review articles will be the primary literature source.",
