    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to provide participants with the fundamental competences required to conceive, design and implement intelligent and distributed control systems combining data-driven and knowledge-based techniques. The course work offers participants an application-oriented introduction to machine learning and declarative methods of artificial intelligence. Course participants will learn the practical aspect of intelligent systems with respect to use-cases and top level design to design.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify and discuss situation awareness, decision, and control tasks in an intelligent systems problem.\nApply machine learning methods to data modeling problems in intelligent systems and evaluate their effectiveness.\nWork with a large data set, perform data exploration and feature extraction to derive knowledge from data in a real-world automation problem.\nExplain structured knowledge representation techniques and related modeling principles, and select suitable knowledge representations for integration in an intelligent systems solution.\nDescribe suitable uses of logic-based and declarative methods applied to the solution of decision making problems in intelligent systems.\nExplain and select appropriate methods as well as the corresponding data models and knowledge representations as part of a design problem.\nAnalyse an intelligent systems design problem, communicate the design idea, formulate specifications and test requirements.\nDesign, implement and evaluate an operational prototype of an intelligent system using data-driven and declarative programming techniques applied to a distributed systems problem.",
    "Content": "Introduction to intelligent systems problems, task analysis, systems development approaches & architecture elements; applications of intelligent systems in automation, Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Grid / Energy problems.\nDistributed systems basics: concurrency, communication, and debugging.\nStructured knowledge representation (e.g. ontologies) and applications to declarative and logic-based programming methods (e.g. rule-based logic, graph-search, ... ).\nHandling large data sets; data visualization; applied statistical learning methods. Quality of data-driven models.",
