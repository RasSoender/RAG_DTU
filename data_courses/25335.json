    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course introduces the student to the different engineering and technological aspects of a range of active and passive fishing gears, and common ways of modifying gear designs to alter the catch composition in accordance with the interest of different stakeholders. The student will become familiar with the biology of important commercial species and the behavioral mechanisms relevant to the catchability and selectivity of different capture methods. Environmental impacts, physical and biological, of different gear types will be introduced and include seabed impact, CO2 emissions, and unwanted catch. Innovations in fisheries technology will give examples of smart-fishing and focus on state-of-the-art technology for future fisheries. The societal importance of developing fishing gears will be given in the perspective of sustainability and management, coexistence of fisheries and an increased use of marine areas for human activities, and through technical measures at a global and regional scale, but with emphasize on Danish fisheries.\nThis course is recommended as a base for students that want to proceed with the courses 25336 or 25616 to obtain more in-depth knowledge and skills in relation to fishing gear technology and innovation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSummarize the characteristics of the fishing sector and its societal importance.\nCompare the most important commercial fishing methods and their basic capture principles, relate the gear components to their function in the capture process, and differentiate between the capture processes of active and passive fishing gears.\nRelate biological adaptations and behavioral mechanisms of important commercial species to the catchability of different fishing methods as well as evaluate different observation techniques and classify behavioral units in ethograms based on observations.\nInterpret species and size selectivity patterns and describe the role of fish behavior and morphology in the selection process of both active and passive fishing gears.\nExplain overfishing, discards, and unaccounted mortalities, relate to cause mechanisms, including ALDFG, and determine appropriate management mitigation measures.\nAssess the benthic impact of different types of fishing gears and gear components, relate this to the impact on benthic organisms, habitats and biodiversity, and determine appropriate management conservation measure.\nExplain sustainable fishing and relate catching methods, gear modifications, and innovative technologies to their potential of reducing unwanted catch and environmental impacts.\nExplain different fishery regulatory systems, control methods, and the implementation process of new gears.",
    "Content": "The landing obligation implemented with the Common Fisheries Policy in European waters is a game-changer for the fishing sector. Solutions for avoiding unwanted catch, which previously could be discarded, are high in demand. After an overview of the commercial fishing sector, this course introduces the most common fishing methods. The students will be familiarized with the biology and behavior related to the catchability of the most important commercial species, and the technical and biological principles that influences selectivity of active and passive fishing gears. Furthermore, methods to analytically assess the selective properties of a gear based on the composition of the retained catch will be introduced. The students will get to know design principles for modifying gears to increase selectivity of unwanted catch or minimize seabed impact and fuel consumption. They will also be familiar with management measure to mitigate these negative impacts and to conserve habitats and biodiversity. The students will be introduced to what sustainability is and how fisheries can coexist with an increased human exploitation of marine areas. Principles of the technical legislation and methods for controlling the compliance of fishing gears will be presented. The students will work with theoretical and hands-on assignments in groups, including a visit to the aquarium. They will be given a development task from which they will produce a written report.",
    "Remarks": "The course provides the necessary basic knowledge for students interested in progressing academically or as a stakeholder within subjects interacting with fishing gears at any level.\nThis course is recommended as a base for students that want to proceed with the courses 25336 and 25616 to obtain more in-depth knowledge and skills in relation to gear technology innovation.\nThis course provides students with competences relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #2 (Zero hunger), #12 (Responsible consumption and production) and #14 (Life below water), but also #9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure) and #13 (Climate action).",
