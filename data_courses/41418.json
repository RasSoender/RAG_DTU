    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable students to evaluate green fuels and power-to-X, including the role in a future green energy system, and advantages and disadvantages of the various fuels. A main objective is to learn how to design, model and analyse fuel production systems taking emissions, economics and thermodynamic performance into account. Note that power-to-X covers production of many different products that can be produced from power (electricity). This course will focus on the production of fuels from power, but also on the production of chemicals such as methanol and ammonia. Power-to-heat by using a heat pump is not a part of the course.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the role of green fuels and power-to-X in a future green energy system\nList the most important green fuels – including advantages and disadvantages\nExplain how these fuels can be produced from feedstocks such as biomass, CO2 and green electricity\nExplain the concept of polygeneration (fuel, electricity, heat, biochar, fertilizer) and the potential benefits of high plant flexibility\nDiscuss the appropriate end use of each fuel type (combustion engine, gas turbine, fuel cell or used as chemical)\nCalculate the climate impact of various fuels including the choice of production method and feedstock\nCalculate the energy efficiency of the various production methods and the overall energy efficiency when including the end use conversion efficiency\nUse economic data to evaluate the economic performance of different fuel types and production methods\nDesign and model a simplified fuel production system using component based thermodynamic software such as Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA) or Aspen Plus",
    "Content": "The course deals with fuels (and chemicals) such as methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), methane, ammonia and jet fuel, and answers questions such as: What are the advantages and disadvantages of each fuel? How can these fuels be produced? What is the appropriate end use of a certain fuel? What is the climate impact, economic performance and the overall energy efficiency of a certain fuel?\n\nThe main technologies covered in the course include: thermal gasification and pyrolysis of biomass, electrolysis, catalytic synthesis of fuels and chemicals, but also carbon capture and storage (CCS) for hydrogen production from natural gas, as well as carbon capture and use (CCU).\n\nDuring the course you will conduct a design project in a group about green fuels or power-to-X. The project may focus on a specific fuel and could cover the following parts: 1) a description of the fuel, and advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative fuels, 2) the potential role in a green energy system, 3) possible production pathways and indicative economics of selected pathways, 4) a thermodynamic simulation of a simplified production system or a more detailed simulation of key parts of a production system. This simulation will be done by using a component based thermodynamic software such DNA (developed at the department) or the commercial software Aspen Plus.",
