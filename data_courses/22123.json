    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E4A",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\nA precision medicine project is prepared in groups, which forms the background for the exam. Active participation in the group work and handing in the project on time are prerequisites for attending the exam. The oral exam will be a group presentation of the project, followed by individual examinations in the full curriculum. The final grade is based on an overall assessment of both the report and the oral examination of the project.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of this course is to enable the students to apply a range of computational tools for precision medicine. In this course, we emphasize topics in precision diagnostics, such as patient stratification using gene expression profiling, as well as precision therapeutics, with a focus on identification and evaluation of targets for cancer immunotherapy.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the concepts of applied precision medicine in the clinic.\nexplain the concepts of treatment stratification of cancer patients and describe strengths and weaknesses of using bulk gene expression profiling.\nexplain the concepts of cancer immunotherapy and discuss the challenges of target selection.\napply basic methods for unsupervised clustering based on gene expression.\napply basic methods for sample classification based on gene expression.\napply differential gene expression analysis to find potential tumor associated antigens.\nanalyze isoform switches to identify potential cell membrane antigens.\ncreate bioinformatics workflows for diagnostics, prognostics, and antigen identification.",
    "Content": "In this course, the students will be introduced to bioinformatics methods in precision medicine. The students will learn how transcriptomics data from microarrays or RNA sequencing can be used for diagnostics and patient stratification for selecting optimal treatments. The students will also learn the principles of precision and personalized therapeutics by analyzing RNA and DNA sequencing data.\n\nEach lecture consists of an introduction to a clinical problem by a domain expert from translational research and/or a clinician, followed by an introduction to how to solve the problem bioinformatically, followed by hands on exercises. The latter two will be based on the programming language R.\n\nThe evaluation is based on hands on group projects, in which a precision medicine problem is solved. The students can either choose a predefined project or come up with their own.",
    "Course literature": "The curriculum for this course will consist of primary research articles. This list will be updated yearly and will appear on the course website at least 3 weeks before the course starts.",
