    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aims of the course are to educate people with a theoretical and practical knowledge of corrosion and corrosion-related degradation of materials, mainly metals, and to relate how corrosion is an important aspect in relation to sustainable use of materials and products. The course is multidisciplinary, combining metallurgy, electrochemistry and general materials degradation (corrosion, wear, fatigue etc). The course will enable the student, on the basis of both a theoretical foundation and practical and analytical abilities, to choose materials solutions to corrosion related materials degradation problems, mostly in metals but also for polymers. Emphasis will be placed on the students' ability to combine theory and practical knowledge and to be able to produce realistic materials selection solutions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe electrochemical theory of corrosion and types of corrosion and mechanisms\nselect optimal corrosion testing by electrochemical methods and estimate corrosion rates\nevaluate the relationship between a metals microstructure and its ability to resist corrosion\nidentify and apply international standards in the area of corrosion\nplan and carry out a corrosion case-study taken from industry and produce a damage analysis report\nsuggest solutions to corrosion problems including making changes in materials selection or the use of inhibitors\nevaluate new materials and new material applications involving metals and polymers for which corrosion is major issue\ndescribe the importance of corrosion for sustainable constructions and how to deal with it",
    "Content": "The course will start with a consideration of corrosion related degradation of metallic materials, but will also consider degradation of polymers.\nThe course is divided into theoretical and practical parts, in which the practicals demonstrate and allow application of the theory learned.\nThe course will start by considering the thermodynamics of corrosion and will consider polarization phenomena, including principles for the estimation of corrosion rates. The course will consider various forms of corrosion, including combined corrosion and mechanical factors (wear, fatigue, etc) that can cause accelerated degradation of materials.\nDuring the course, emphasis will be placed on the choice of solutions that can eliminate or reduce corrosion and material degradation, and importance in relation to sustainability. In connection with the practical part of the course, training in the application of software to make thermodynamic calculations, as well as literature searches and identification of relevant standards, will be given. In connection with the practical part of the course it will be possible to used advanced equipment to characterize the corrosion of materials in selected environments.",
