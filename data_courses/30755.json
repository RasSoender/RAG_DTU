    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Earth and Space Physics Engineering\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Environmental Engineering\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Earth and Space Physics and Engineering\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Environmental Engineering",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E2A (Mon 13-17)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "Primarily case-based teaching. For most topics, one or more relevant cases are presented. The students will get to work on the cases themselves. The focus is on working with real climate data to give the students an understanding of how we know the current state of Earth's climate. The latest report from the UN's climate panel IPCC will be used as literature along with scientific papers.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E2A, F2A",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , external examiner",
    "Previous Course": "30754",
    "Not applicable together with": "30754",

    "Department": "30 National Space Institute",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo understand where our knowledge of Earth's climate comes from. To be able to analyse climate data and put it into the context of Earth's climate system.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nanalyze relevant climate data\ncritically appraise scientific literature\ncompare climate forcing and feedback\nevaluate trends in global temperature data\nexplain how global climate models work\nexplain how temperature is measured and how temperature measurements are used in global analysis\ndiscuss how observations are used in models to compute atmospheric reanalysis.\nappraise sea surface temperature changes and consequences for the climate system\nappraise sea level changes and their relation to the melting of glaciers and heating of the oceans\nappraise the role of sea ice for the radiation balance and its effect on the climate system\nexplain different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and their effect on future climate.",
    "Content": "The course focuses on the data behind specific climate processes. Topics covered are: Global surface temperature, sea level, sea ice, climate forcing and feedback, and climate models (primarily the big Earth System Models). This course provides students with competencies relevant to UN SDGs, for example, #13 (Climate Action) and #14 (Life below water).",
    "Course literature": "The latest IPCC report (currently Assessment Report 6: IPCC, 2021: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Masson-Delmotte, V., P. Zhai, A. Pirani, S.L. Connors, C. Péan, S. Berger, N. Caud, Y.
