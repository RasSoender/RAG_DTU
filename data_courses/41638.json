    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nManagement of complexity is crucial for successfull development of products and business processes. To avoid superfluous complexity in products and processes the innovation process needs to include an analysis and synthesis of complexity and the impact of complexity. Furthermore the impact of complexity must be quantified in terms of impact on costs, delivery performance, flow in production, quality etc. In this course we focus on quantification of costs of complexity. The course objective is to give students competencies and operational skills to analyse and quantify complexity costs in a company. Furthermore, the course aims at achieving an understanding of the basic principles of complexity management, and how to apply these principles when making strategy for products and processes. Learning takes place through project work, where operational skills within analysis and quantification of complexity costs are learned.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply the fundamentals of complexity management, and how to control complexity when developing products and business processes\nAnalyse complexity in an industrial company and identify the most important causes of complexity, including the connection between complexity of products and complexity of business processes\nTo classify products in A (80 %), B (15 %) and C (5 %) categories in relation to turnover and contribution margin\nIdentify and quantify the most important complexity factors\nIdentify initiatives for the reduction of complexity of products and processes, and how these initiatives contribute to the company's strategy.\nQuantify possible economies / gains of the suggested initiatives for the reduction of complexity\nModel products for reduction of complexity\nOptimise product assortment with respect to contribution margins",
    "Content": "The course focuses on quantification of costs of complexity and development of initiatives for reduction of complexity, as well as quantification of expected reduction of costs from implementing the initiatives. Furthermore it is explained how these freed resources can be applied to develop new products and to increase the revenue on profitable customers and products. The assignment begins with an analysis of the productâ€™s features and separation of products into A (80 %), B (15 %) and C (5 %) categories in relation to turnover and contribution margin. After this, costs of complexity are being quantified, and allocated to the individual products. Based on an analysis of profitability and costs of complexity for products and product families, initiatives are developed for reduction of costs of complexity. The expected reduction of costs for the initiatives is quantified, and a plan is made for implementation.",
