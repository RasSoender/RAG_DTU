    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course shall give the students an understanding of the following:\nDevelopment of system products and solutions for new and energy-renovated buildings with focus on energy use and efficiency. The solutions are based on the building envelope, heat recovery, and active/passive solutions for heating and cooling. An integral part of the product development is to assess the solutions from different perspectives: energy, indoor climate, building technology, durability, economy and grid-integration. The course will enable the students to develop energy-efficient products useful for the building industry as system products in high performing buildings.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze the performance of energy-efficient system products as used in high performance buildings\nDefine design-criteria for system solutions in high performance buildings\nExecute a product development process based on analyses of the need for improved products in the field of energy-efficient building envelope components and HVAC-systems\nPropose and justify solutions based on performance criteria\nInterpret and adopt a commercial perspective when developing system products\nReport and contrast energy performance, cost and industrialization potential of building envelope components and HVAC solutions\nDesign and document coherent and integrated proposals of high-performance buildings\nFormulate reports with presentations of the results of topics listed above based on evaluation of which information is relevant for the client (external) and internal documentation",
    "Content": "The potential for optimizaton and integration is enormous in the building sector. In this course, we develop, optimize and integrate components and systems into high-performing, energy-efficient buildings. The CDIO framework is used to guide the development of new solutions to fulfill the performance criteria, either as stand-alone or integrated solutions.\nThe course works with new solutions in:\n-Highly insulated building envelopes\n-Ventilation systems with efficient heat recovery and low electrical energy use\n-Windows, glazings and shadings with good energy and daylight balance\n-Building integrated heating and cooling systems that makes rational use of free heat gains, free cooling, and integrated heat storages\n-Grid-supportive systems and operation\nBased on the CDIO framework, the solutions are being thoroughly analyzed, optimized, and integrated into system products that both supports industrialization of the building sector and in turn benefits from industrialized production. The customer is the professional building industry rather than the occupant. The performance of the solutions are being assessed using advanced and detailed simulation tools, e.g. IDA ICE or similar. In the final report, the solutions are being put together and documented in a building.",
