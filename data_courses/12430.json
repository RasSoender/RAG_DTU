    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nMinerals and mineral resources are found everywhere in our daily lives. An understanding of their properties and structure is essential for our understanding of their roles in, for example, the underground, the environment or in building materials. In this course we will review the most important minerals and gain insight into their formation and their properties by using e.g. petrographic microscopy and X-ray diffraction.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ncharacterize different types of minerals based on their crystal chemistry, crystal structure and physical properties\napply knowledge of mineral anisotropy to understand the resulting physical properties\ninterpret the geological processes behind the formation of a natural mineral assemblage (rock or sediment)\nidentify rock-forming minerals using optical microscopy\ninterpret and justify results from X-ray diffraction experiments\nevaluate relevant industrial values and uses of minerals based on mineralogical characteristics\nanalyze mineral deposits using geostatistical evaluation\nidentify and describe the different stages of a mineral extraction operation",
    "Content": "Mineralogy, minerals, mineral properties, X-ray diffraction, mineral resources, geology, igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks, sediments, plate tectonics.",
