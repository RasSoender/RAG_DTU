    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the participants with an understanding of management of recreational fishing and its interdisciplinary intersection between social and natural science. This includes management elements such as habitat restoration and fishery regulations as well as socio-economic and human dimension aspects, e.g. understanding how heterogeneity among recreational fishers can impact management decisions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine recreational fishing including a description of different angling types/techniques.\nExplain different management strategies for recreational fishery, e.g. adaptive management.\nDescribe and explain strengths and weaknesses of habitat restoration and fish stocking as management tools in recreational fisheries.\nDescribe, compare, and explain the purpose and effects of different fishery control initiatives used to regulate harvest of target fish populations e.g. slot length, quota, minimum size limits, closed seasons, closed areas and critically review their efficiency.\nPresent and discuss pros and cons of catch-and-release fishing (C&R) as a management tool and give specific guidelines to how mortality and sub-lethal effects in C&R fishing can be minimized (i.e., best practice).\nDescribe, explain, and give examples of values and impacts of recreational fishing in terms of economics and human dimension aspects.\nDescribe traditional and novel survey methods used to investigate different aspects of recreational fishing (e.g., fisheries metrics, biological information, human dimensions), explain their strengths and weaknesses, and provide survey design for specific fisheries.\nExplain angler heterogeneity using the recreation specialization framework, how it is measured and how it translates into angler behavior and the implications for management e.g., in terms of fishing trip motivation, consumption orientation and attitudes towards conservation and regulations.\nGive examples of different direct and indirect biological impacts of recreational fisheries on aquatic ecosystems.\nProduce management solutions to specific recreational fisheries management problems and explain the biological, socio economical and/or conservation arguments behind the advice.",
    "Content": "Recreational fishing is a billion euro business which directly and indirectly impacts the ecology of aquatic ecosystems, e.g. through effects on the environment, food webs or on specific populations, as well as various human dimensions, e.g., in terms of social and economic processes and consequences. Moreover, when managing recreational fisheries it seems just as important to understand angler behavior as it is to understand population dynamics and behaviour of fish. Therefore, the interdisciplinary interaction between social and natural science holds the future for successful recreational fisheries management. The course will introduce adaptive management and the three tools in traditional recreational fishery management; fish stocking, habitat restoration and fishery regulation, with special focus on the latter (e.g. catch and release fishing, bag limits, closed seasons etc.) In addition, human dimensions, such as angler typology, behavior and demography, ethical costs, and socio-economic benefits to the community from angling will be addressed. Finally, a part of the course will be dedicated to introducing the methodologies that typically are used when investigating biological impacts and the human dimensions in recreational fishing.\nThe course will be a mixture of lectures, exercises, and self-study, all aligned with the learning objectives. In addition, the students will have to prepare written assignments, containing elements given by the teacher and others chosen by the student.",
