    "Department": "34 Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the professor's office",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThrough participation in a research project in a shorter period of time, the student will try to answer a question or solve a problem, which is connected to the work of the supervisor. The student will also gain general competencies, e.g. the ability to participate in a constructive mentor-mentee relationships and the ability to communicate science â€“ in writing as well as orally.\nTo provide competences in experimental work within power electronics an/or IC design.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPlan and carry out a sequence of experiments with a tight time schedule\nWork with an open problem within power electronics and IC design\nWork in the lab with safety in focus\nParticipate constructively in a research team\nUse equipment and methods in a qualified manner and account for the operational principles\nAccount for the theoretical background / physics behind the experiments\nAnalyse experimental data based on relevant theory\nAccount for and discuss experimental sources of error\nWrite a brief and precise commented lab-journal that makes the results useful also to the other team members\nOrally communicate the main features of a scientific issue\nCommunicate the results of a scientific project in a report shaped like a scientific article\nConstructively participate in a student-supervisor relationship.",
    "Content": "Participation in a short-term research project in close collaboration with a supervising PhD student. The exact content of the project will be further agreed upon with the supervising PhD student. The main points of the scientific issue must be communicated orally. The project must be communicated via a final, written report.\nThe course is an experimental project, and the content of the project is strongly related to the ongoing research within power electronics and/or IC design.",
    "Remarks": "Registration requires an agreement about a project with a supervisor within power electronics and/or IC design at DTU Electro.",
