    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce the students to enzyme kinetics in practice and research methods in applied enzyme technology. The course is based on practical experimental methods and analyses within applied biocatalysis and enzyme technology. After completion of the course, the course participants will be able to:\n•Design, conduct and interpret various types of enzyme activity assays.\n•Examine and interpret quantitative, experimental data from biocatalytic reactions, and understand the importance of considering blanks, substrate specificity, artificial vs. complex/component substrates, heterogeneous enzyme preparations.\n•Plan and conduct experiments to estimate kinetic parameters and analyse progressing biocatalytic reactions.\n•Design a series of experiments in order to analyze a set of quantitative aspects of an enzymatic process of industrial relevance.\n\nThe academic qualifications obtained are targeted towards research and development jobs within biochemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies as well as in academia.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDesign experiments for the determination of enzyme kinetic parameters.\nConduct various types of enzyme activity assays on the basis of general methodological descriptions.\nAnalyze results from these assays in order to estimate enzyme activity, enzyme stability, thermal activation of enzymes, substrate saturation and inhibition constants.\nEvaluate the validity of the enzyme kinetic results such i.e. considerations concerning the use of blank samples, substrate specificity, use of artificial or multiple component substrates and heterogenous enzyme preparations.\nAnalyze experimental data for progressive enzyme reactions.\nCritically read and evaluate scientific articles related to the subject area.\nDesign, plan, and carry out a series of experiments for the quantitative assessment of one or more selected enzyme kinetic phenomena of industrial relevance.\nWork constructively in a small team.\nReport experimental results in a written form in a precise, condensed scientific report structure: Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion, Conclusions.",
    "Content": "The course is built around a number of specific themes that include research/theoretical study as well as conduction of practical experiments that involve biocatalytic reactions. Emphasis is put on unravelling the theory behind the reactions and on designing and conducting the practical experiments. The course curriculum includes assessment of selected large scale processes in which biocatalytic steps are involved. Complex processes that involve advanced exploitation of biocatalysed conversions are also examined. The reactions to be covered relate to specific scientific phenomena, selected industrial applications, and to current research topics. The experimental work is carried out in teams of two, and each team will work with a selection of cases (teams circulate among cases). In addition to the laboratory work, time is allocated for discussing the scientific fundamentals, data interpretation, and for understanding the reaction mechanisms: kinetics, substrate specificity, enzyme stability and synergism between different enzyme activities. Each case must be summarized in a short report including answering of specific questions relating to the particular case.",
    "Remarks": "If you plan to do your MSc project within enzyme technology at DTU or in one of the major biotechnology companies it is advisable to have had this course.",
