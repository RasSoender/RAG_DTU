    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTwo of the world's most powerful microscopes are placed in Lund; one is the X-ray facility MAX IV, which is already in use, and the other is the neutron facility European Spallation Source (ESS) which will start operation in 2025. The overall goal of this course is to get acquainted with this type of advanced microscopy techniques, how you apply these and how you get access to these types of large-scale international facilities. These facilities are widely used by universities and industry for advanced analysis of materials and devices. We will work with X-ray and neutron scattering on both soft and hard materials for applications in biology, chemistry, physics and related materials, energy, biomedical, and life science technologies. We will work with the basic experimental techniques: small-angle scattering, crystal and powder diffraction, inelastic scattering, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and imaging. We will get insights into multi-modal and multi-scale 3D imaging approaches by combining Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray imaging. The course is highly cross-disciplinary and involves participants from the whole Øresund region, which will give rich opportunities for networking.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the basic physical principles for X-ray and neutron scattering\nExplain the basic experimental methods used at large-scale X-ray and neutron facilities\nDescribe elastic, inelastic, coherent and incoherent scattering processes\nExplain absorption processes for X-rays and neutrons\nApply scattering techniques to soft and hard materials\nContribute to experiments at large-scale X-ray and neutron facilities\nExplain multi-modal 3D imaging approaches from applications of Magnetic Resonance Imaging to X-ray imaging techniques\nPerform simple data analysis on data from large-scale X-ray and neutron facilities\nPrepare an application for beam time at a large-scale X-ray and neutron facility",
