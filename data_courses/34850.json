    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce the students to theories and methods in room acoustics and sound insulation with the purpose of providing a background for design buildings with a satisfactory acoustic environment. This means that the building construction eliminates noise transmission problems and that the geometry and surfaces of rooms provides optimal acoustical conditions for the intended uses.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the principles and basic assumptions behind theories used for sound insulation, such as sound radiation and structural waves in plates and statistical energy analysis (SEA).\nPredict the flanking transmission and sound propagation in buildings with homogeneous single walls.\nCalculate the air borne and impact sound insulation of common single and double building constructions, including elements such as floor coverings, floating floors, doors and windows.\nDescribe the sound insulation of older buildings and of modern lightweight constructions.\nCalculate the sound absorption coefficient for common sound absorbers, including porous-, panel- and resonant absorbers.\nRelate the objective acoustic parameters with the subjective impression of the acoustics of a room or building (such as early decay time, clarity, sound reduction index etc.)\nPredict the influence of room geometry and absorption, reflection, diffraction and diffusion properties of surface on the impulse responce and percievd acoustic condition\nDesign the acoustics of rooms for speech and music in cooperation with architects and building engineers.\nUnderstand the basic principles regarding introducing loudspeaker systems for amplification and reverberation enhancement in rooms.\nDescribe the principles and basic assumptions of computer prediction programs such as \"Odeon\" and \"Bastian\" and operate these.\nExplain the basic assumptions and principles of and apply measurement methods in architectural acoustics, including sound insulation, reverberation time, speech intelligibility, sound absorption etc.",
    "Content": "The reflection and absorption of sound. Panel absorbers, resonance absorbers and porous absorbers. Theoretical and subjective room acoustics. Acoustics in new and old theatres, churches and concert halls. Room acoustic parameters. Designing of rooms for speech and music, such as classrooms and music venues. The use of computer models as design tools. Variation of room acoustics by physical changes and by electronic means.\n\nThe sound insulation of buildings and building elements from external and internal noise, including forced and resonant transmission, and single and double walls. Sound radiation from vibrations in walls. Introduction to structure borne sound and statistical energy analysis (SEA). Floating floors and impact sound insulation. Flanking transmission and sound propagation in building constructions. Sound insulation of older buildings and of modern lightweight constructions. Building acoustic test measurements.\n\nAbout one third of the time is used on a building project in which the acoustical conditions are solved by using the knowledge gathered during the course.",
    "Remarks": "It is desirable that the students have a basic knowledge of acoustics and some knowledge of building techniques.\n\nE-learning is used in the form of videos, on-line quiz (home assignments), discussion board/blog and digital exam.",
