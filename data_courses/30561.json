    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe Earth's gravity field varies from location to location depending on the composition of the materials in the subsurface. These variations impact the shape of the Earth and cause the water in the oceans not to coincide with a simple surface. The Geoid is an equipotential surface for gravity describing the zero-level surface. On land, the Geoid is needed to compute heights from satellite positioning.\n\nThe course aims to provide the students with knowledge about the mathematical models and methodology used for describing the Earth's shape and gravity field.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nInterpret and describe the interrelation of gravity and Earth shape\nDesign and carry out a gravity survey, set up and carry out a network adjustment\nList and prioritize the physical processes that contribute to temporal variations in the gravity field of the Earth\nList the defining parameters of the level ellipsoid and identify the difference between gravity disturbances and gravity anomalies\nApply free-air reductions and terrain reductions and describe the Pratt-Hayford and Airy-Heiskanen isostatic reductions\nEvaluate the geopotential and derived quantities from models based on spherical harmonic functions and relate spherical harmonics and mesh grids to spatial resolution\nExplain the contribution of satellite methods to knowledge of the Earth’s gravity field and the knowledge of the shape of the Earth\nDiscriminate between different types of height systems, identify their associated reference surfaces and transform between these\nExplain the concepts of geoid and quasi-geoid and the main techniques to model them\nDescribe the relation between spirit levelling and the gravimetric geoid/quasi-geoid\nModel a quasi-geoid by using the spherical FFT and collocation, describe difference of the two methods and evaluate the results",
    "Content": "The content of the course includes Earth's gravity field, measurement of gravity on land and from aircraft and satellites, computation of the geoid, and satellites and their behaviour in the gravity field, supplemented by elements from statistics and estimation.",
