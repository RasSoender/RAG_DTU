    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall aim of the course is to provide the course participants a comprehensive, quantitative and mechanistic understanding of reactions within applied biocatalysis. This objective encompasses:\n•That the students obtain fundamental knowledge of enzyme kinetics and the principles and mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed reactions and processing steps in genuine applications.\n•That the students obtain a detailed quantitative understanding of the parameters that influence enzyme catalyzed reactions in technological applications.\n•That the students become confident with quantitative enzyme kinetics in theory and practice, and become able to calculate and predict reaction rates, substrate consumption, product formation, extent of reaction, reaction time, and enzyme dosage in realistic, industrial enzyme processes.\n•That the students become confident with the engineering aspects, including scaling and decision logistics, necessary for introduction of biocatalysed reactions in industrial processes.\nThe competencies obtained will equip the students to take jobs in bio-, food, pharma and/or agroindustrial companies, but are also targeted at biochemical and biotechnological research.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCalculate enzyme activity, Vmax and KM from relevant datasets.\nCalculate and predict the effect of temperature- and pH changes on the stability of enzymes and on the reaction rate and the yield of enzyme catalyzed reactions.\nCalculate the influence of inhibitors on the rate and yield of enzyme catalyzed reactions. Understand the quantitative consequences of different types of inhibitor-mechanisms.\nUse Michaelis-Menten based enzyme kinetics incl. integrated rate equations for the calculation of rates, substrate depletion, product formation, degree of reaction, necessary reaction time and enzyme dosage in genuine enzyme processes.\nAnalyze and evaluate experimental enzyme kinetic data from scientific papers concerning technological applications/effects of enzymes.\nDescribe a number of important technical, industrial enzyme applications and -processes.\nQuantify enzymatic depolymerization reactions (e.g. on polysaccharides and polymers) that do not immediately follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\nBe confident with quantitative metrics used for assessing enzyme catalyzed reactions in an industrial context and obtain insight into decision-making for evaluating enzymatic/biocatalyzed processes.\nDescribe the principles for either using soluble or immobilized enzymes, batch reactions or reactors and evaluate advantages vs. disadvantages of each technique.",
    "Content": "The course introduces the fundamental concepts and practical use of quantitative enzyme kinetics in biocatalytic processes, with particular focus on: enzyme activity, assays, catalytic specificity, high extents of substrate conversion, and reactions ocurring at extreme reaction conditions. Fundamentals of Michaelis-Menten and non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics with emphasis on handling and interpretation of quantitative data and mathematical expressions in genuine reactions and processes: mono-substrate transformations, depolymerization, insoluble substrates, and immobilised enzymes. The quantitative influence of pH, temperature, inhibitors, and other critical factors. Classic, new, and future biocatalytic processes are discussed. Application technology is described from the perspective of the chemical type of substrate and from the perspective of the relevant industrial sector. The examples thus relate to a large number of different industrial applications.",
    "Remarks": "It is advantageous to supplement the course with: 27247 Experimental Enzyme Technology, that may be taken during the same semester or in a later semester. If you plan to do your MSc project in one of the major biotechnology companies it is advisable to have had this course.",
