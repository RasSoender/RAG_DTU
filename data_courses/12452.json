    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose of the course is to achieve competences within the field of design and maintenance of railways for high-speed trains and freight – this includes track alignment, stations, power supply and Overhead Catenary System.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the infrastructure elements of railways, the affiliated standards, and the relation to their traffic functionality\nExplain the horizontal and vertical elements of a railway. Describe why and where cant is used and determine its size\nExplain the elements in a cross section; explain why cross slope is applied to the sub ballast\nDesign a track alignment for a speed upgrade using a CAD based railway design system\nDescribe the differences of various traction power supply systems and estimate the power demand\nDescribe the principles for the function of overhead contact line systems, determine the location of supporting structures along track according to a given track geometry and be able to profile overhead contact wires below bridges\nCarry out a realistic design project for track and overhead contact line for a railway line\nExplain how a railway is constructed with respect to the maintenance aspect of the infrastructure\nDescribe the phases in a railway project\nKnow the methodology for budgeting and cost estimating a railway project\nDescribe and explain why preventive maintenance impacts the life cycle of the railway",
    "Content": "The need of efficient and climate friendly mobility is setting up new targets for planning modern transport infrastructure as a prerequisite to bring people and freight fast through regions, in and out of urban areas or across borders. In this context it can be seen that spatial planning schemes and strategies more and more involve a design of new rail transport infrastructure.\n\nThe course will examine the practical application of track engineering principles. The course focuses on electrified railways (a sustainable transport solution) with emphasis on how to design the horizontal and vertical alignment, together with the catenary system in a CAD-program; taking into consideration the maintenance of the track design. Furthermore, the course also provides important competences for cost and budgeting of a railway project in the different phases of construction, inauguration and daily operation.\nThe course program includes a case of a railway track suitable for regional express trains running 200 km/h, even faster long-distance passenger trains, and heavy freight trains.\n\nAs a part of the course an excursion will be arranged to visit a real railway construction site in order to achieve a better understanding of the elements of the railway infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, it will be possible during the course to meet several experts within the rail transport industry.\n\nThe course is taught in English.",
