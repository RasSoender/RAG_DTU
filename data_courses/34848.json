    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAcoustic microsystems include small devices such as hearables, hearing aids, small electroacoustic transducers, etc. The objective of this project course is to bring the student in contact with current research and innovation challenges faced by a partner from the audio and hearing aid industry; to get insight into specific issues in microacoustics; to understand, analyze, and solve a well-defined acoustic engineering problem within a short deadline.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze a technical challenge and design solutions with limited resources.\nSet up a suitable model using LEM, BEM, or FEM to describe a complex acoustic-mechanical problem.\nCombine models to describe electrical, mechanical, and acoustic components.\nConsider challenges specific to acoustic microsystems and include them in models.\nOptimize model parameters to achieve target performance.\nAnalyze simulation results to conclude and design different solutions.\nEfficiently work in a group to fulfill a short deadline.\nPresent the technical process, decisions, and results in writing and orally.",
    "Content": "In the course an industrial partner will pose a technical challenge for sound propagation and effects in acoustic microsystems. A crash-course and hands-on training provides a rapid introduction to the necessary modelling tools, such as COMSOL Multiphysics.\nStudents will work together in group projects to find solutions for the challenge. They will employ analytical and numerical methods to describe sound generation and propagation in order to find optimized design parameters. Proposed solutions will be evaluated in close cooperation with company engineers. Prototype designs may be realized using additive manufacturing.",
    "Remarks": "The course content are linked to research activities at the Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Microsystems (CAMM). The students will get into contact and work with engineers from an industrial CAMM partner.",
