    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course, you will get the opportunity to apply the knowledge you have gained during the \"Innovation in Teams\" courses to projects within the Physics Department research portfolio. Through a combination of lectures, worked examples and lab exposure, you will become skilled in assessing the commercialisation potential of a scientific research project - determining whether the unique aspects of the research topic or method can be applied in a new way in a commercial context for the benefit of society.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEvaluate the commercialisation potential of the abilities and technologies embodied in a research project (identify, evaluate and prioritise the opportunities)\nDetermine the fit between these abilities and technologies and the needs of a customer (determine the value proposition)\nProduce a reasoned evaluation of the challenges and risks involved in bringing the opportunity to the market\nUnderstand the difference between disruptive and process innovation, and be able to identify both types of opportunity within research projects\nApply frameworks for systematic innovation to generate creative potential solutions to challenges that might be solved using the competencies and techniques available at the Physics Department\nGenerate new ideas for the commercialisation of research output through a multi- and cross-disciplinary approach\nProduce a portfolio of prioritized commercialisation opportunities that documents the nature of the opportunity and the challenges in bringing it to market, that clearly communicates to an audience without a formal training in innovation tools.\nGet practice in the application of an 'innovation lens' to evaluating the commercialisation potential of research projects",
    "Content": "The course will consist of a mix of lectures, worked examples and introductions to laboratory work. You will get practice in the application of the Market Opportunity Navigator framework, a tool for identifying core abilities and technologies and matching these with potential customers. You will assess the commercial potential of the possible matches, and consider the challenges involved. Based on this, you will build a portfolio of evaluated innovation ideas to be presented to the project owner. To help you, we will provide supporting lectures on innovation, including disruptive vs. process innovation, technological S-curves, and the Systematic Innovation framework for innovation problem solving. You will also get the chance to get insight from industry experts on innovation within their businesses.",
