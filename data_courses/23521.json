    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nEnable the students to evaluate and design processing facilities and equipment for food production and preparation, which meet legislative requirements as well as standards and guidelines for hygienic design.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain and apply legislation, standards, guidelines incl. certifications concerning hygienic design and food contact materials in EU\nEvaluate hygienic design aspects of construction materials, surface characteristics and equipment design details in regards to cleanability\nAnalyze hygienic design of processing equipment in open and closed systems\nApply criteria of hygienic design to identify cases where the relevant legislation has been violated\nExamine hygienic design of processing plants, the rooms where processing takes place and placement of equipment\nDevelop conceptual re-designs of process equipment and processing lines based on information about construction materials, maintenance and cleaning procedures\nSelect suitable materials (stainless steel and polymers) and post treatments of materials to implement hygienic design\nIdentify potential corrosive environments in the food industry and recognize corrosion failures commonly seen in the food industry\nDesign proper cleaning and disinfection procedures for specific soils and process types and explain the effect of basic types of detergents and sanitizers\nApply procedures in employee personal hygiene and pest control",
    "Content": "The objective of hygienic design of processing equipment and unit operations is to ensure high quality and safe food products, optimal processing times and total runtime of a process line.\n\nThe course will deal with design of processing equipment and process lines from the hygienic design point of view with respect to material choices and structures based on existing laws, rules, norms and guidelines. The following are examples of topics which will be covered in the course:\n• Legislation and guidelines for hygienic design,\n• Good and inappropriate equipment designs in both open and closed processing systems,\n• Methods to characterize surface structures (topology) and to test equipment cleanability,\n• The impact of construction materials and structures on the hygienic quality, e.g., cleanability of surfaces (stainless steel, weldings, polymers and elastomers),\n• Corrosion types seen in the food industry and overview of material types most commonly used,\n• Efficiency of cleaning agents and cleaning methods including fluid flows,\n• Hygienic considerations in the construction of a food processing plant including site selection, product flow and hygiene in processing.",
