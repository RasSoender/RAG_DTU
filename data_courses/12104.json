    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\n4 group assignments + 4 multiple choice individual exam (ca. 15-20 min each) + 15 min oral exam",
    "Exam duration": "Group oral exam in the exam period",
    "Aid": "All Aids - with access to the internet",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , external examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "02002/02003.­02402.­12102/12111 , Programming (mainly Python) is an essential prerequisite for the course. Students not having previous programming knowledge are required to get basic skills before the start of the course (refer to the material available at cp.compute.dtu.dk). Good knowledge of both statistics (02402) and environmental processes (12102/12111) is required to achieve the course learning objectives",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to provide students the basic knowledge to work with mathematical models and apply them to environmental problems, providing the theoretical basis for subsequent applications in specialization courses. The course has four major elements: i) simple mass balances using big environmental datasets, ii) deterministic modelling using ordinary differential equations, iii) deterministic modelling using partial differential equations and iv) model optimisation, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis. The course builds on a series of examples drawn from the field of environmental engineering and employs programming tools and languages (e.g., COMSOL Multiphysics, Python) to illustrate the general modelling principles. The course will teach students how to integrate observed data with models and apply them to describe environmental problems and evaluate model results .",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply fundamental physical, chemical and biological knowledge to mathematically describe an environmental problem\nIdentify and describe the governing processes, boundary and initial conditions that are relevant to environmental problems.\nFormulate mass balances, ordinary and partial differential equations based on process understanding\nEmploy numerical and analytical techniques, using programming and modelling tools to simulate environmental systems\nEvaluate model results and their uncertainty\nUnderstand model behaviour through sensitivity analysis\nApply parameter estimation by employing measured data\nCommunicate modelling results in a clear, concise, and convincing manner",
    "Content": "Topics will include selections from the following: Modelling terminology; model building process; zero-dimensional mass balances of environmental problems; environmental models based on coupled ordinary and partial differential equations, including modelling of mass and energy conservation and reactive transport, and models of microbial processes; sensitivity analysis; parameter estimation and optimisation; stochastic modelling; programming. Example cases are taken from the fields fate and effects of chemicals in the environment, groundwater flow and transport, and urban water systems.",
    "Remarks": "The course is a mandatory course for the MSc in Environmental Engineering.\nIt is recommended that MSc students complete the course in their first year of study.\nIt is essential that all the academic prerequisites are met at the beginning of the course (programming, statistics) or during the semester (environmental processes).",
