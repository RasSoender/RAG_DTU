    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course main objective is to equip students with key competencies to work with external partners in a semi-facilitated global innovation journey to turn a sustainability challenge into a solution that they will pitch and present at an international congress for feedback and acceleration.\n\nThe course is associated with the Next Generation [ ] Action programme led by DTU Skylab in partnership with DTU Sustain and partners, which engages students across the globe in an innovation journey during a 3-week period and brings them and their solutions into an international congress. Students will be facilitated through an innovation process to turn concrete sustainability challenges brought forward by partners into inclusive and sustainable technology solutions that will be showcased at an international congress. The course timing may be subject to change on an annual basis, but agreed by the beginning of the year, to match the best journey of the selected international congress.\n\nFor the 2025-edition, the program is in collaboration with the Digital Tech Summit in Copenhagen (https://event.ing.dk/digitaltechsummit), and with the title, ‘Next Generation Digital Action’. In 2025 the course takes place during part of the 3-weeks period in June and with 3 mandatory ‘action-days’ together with the international course participants as part of the programme during Digital Tech Summit (3rd, 5th and 6th of November).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDemonstrate an understanding and application of an innovative and entrepreneurial mindset\nSelect and apply adequate methods and tools for working in the different stages of an innovative development process\nExplain and apply the principles of universal design\nContribute with own disciplinary background in the different stages of the innovation process\nDevelop and test prototypes to validate technical and business hypotheses\nCreate a business plan and make a pitch\nCreate a plan for congress participation and inviting for partnerships\nGive and receive constructive and appropriate feedback to and from team members and international teams\nCommunicate the design of a fitting innovation concept in relation to the problem at hand to relevant stakeholders\nPresent and drive forward ideas into an international congress",
    "Content": "Innovation and entrepreneurial competencies complement engineers’ already specialised knowledge and enable them to turn these challenges into opportunities.\n\nIn this course, students will work in teams of 3-5 students to tackle a real-world challenge, connecting with other student teams in Korea, India, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Ghana, Colombia and Mexico to develop inclusive, sustainable and actionable solutions to global problems proposed by challenge owners from around the world. Lectures and workshops will be facilitated virtually to accommodate the international placement of some student teams, but students are expected to work on their projects in person at their local university (DTU Lyngby Campus) and receive one-on-one support.\n\nThe June 2025 version of the course will focus on “digital technologies transforming societies - leaving no one behind\",\n\nThis course is divided into two parts: i) a development period consisting of group project work supported by lectures, workshops, keynotes, joint reflection sessions, mentoring sessions, and meetings with challenge owners (4-26th of June), and ii) A pre-summit program and Digital Tech Summit (3-7th of November, where the 3rd, 5th and 5th are obligatory).\n\nAs part of the course, the students will:\na) Join an international hybrid program with virtual, physical and mixed activities\nb) Develop innovation and entrepreneurial mindset and competencies\nc) Work with innovation and entrepreneurship in practice in a cross-disciplinary and international team context\nd) Work on and develop solutions to a real-world challenge with external partners\ne) Translate research, and best practices from their own context to new concepts and innovations\nf) Collaborate with national and international stakeholders\ng) Attend a leading international congress where they exhibit and pitch their solution\nh) Communicate to and network with relevant stakeholders and build partnerships",
