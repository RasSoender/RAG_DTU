    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to train the student in defining achievable project-objectives, divide a complex project-objective into manageable sub-task, as well as in addressing the necessary scientific skills and background for carrying out the project. The results will be communicated as an oral presentation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndesign and carry out a pilot study in connection to a research project.\nunderstand and evaluate the content of a scientific paper or patent.\ndisseminate the content of a scientific paper or patent for fellow students and project partners.\ndemonstrate understanding and overview of complex and multidisciplinary research projects.\ncompartmentalize a complex task into individual sub-tasks.\nformulate and carry out tasks within a limited time frame.\ndescribe and conduct an original and systematic scientific investigation.\nselect and implement methods necessary for conducting a research project.",
    "Content": "The course is an individual project defined by the master project supervisor together with the prospective master student and should work as a pilot project to the master project. This means that the course must be timed to take place just before the start of the master project and must comprise activities related to the master project for example preparatory lab work and/or giving an overview of background literature. In addition the course must include developing and presenting a project plan for the master project.",
    "Remarks": "This course constitutes the second module of the integrated second year courses on the Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering MSc program. The students will preferably be working within the framework of the groups formed at the module 1 course (24690/33690). However, students are expected to divide the project and work on the different parts individually.",
