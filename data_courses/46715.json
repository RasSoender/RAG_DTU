    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give a solid background for understanding and calculation of the generation and characteristics of electrical transients in selected electric power systems.\nAlso knowledge will be achieved within component's high frequent equivalents and the influence of transients on these components and on the grid.\nThe students will become familiar with PSCAD as numerical tool for time domain simulations and a number of other methods used in power engineering.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCalculate simple transients analytically and numerically\nEstablish broad band models for some common components\nEvaluate a component's electrical characteristics under transient voltages\nUse PSCAD as numerical tool for time domain simulations\nDistinguish between models with and without distributed parametres\nApply a number of electromagnetic principles to power components\nCalculate over voltages under switching events and lightning exposure\nUnderstand the basic principles of overvoltage protection",
    "Content": "A number of fundamental topics relevant for the power system and its components will be treated.\nTransients occur under lightning and under switching processes in the grid, including closing and breaking actions.\nCalculation of overvoltages requires application of high frequent component equivalents based on lumped circuits, as well as including transmission line models with distributed parameters.\nIn particular will be treated cables, breakers and transformers in different configurations. Also covered are calculation of overvoltages in overhead line systems under lightning.\nThe system's response and resistance against these transients are investigated by means of insulation coordination.\nThe numerical tool used in the larger assignment is PSCAD.",
