    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with theoretical and partiular practical insight and understanding in GMP, hygiene and quality management systems, comprising legal requirements, guidelines, documentation and practical implementation, used in companies within the pharmaceutical, biotechnological and food industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify the necessary quality requirements imposed to an organisation and its buildings, production equipment, personnel and procedures of a pharmaceutical, biotech or food company, which is subject to follow GMP regulations, food regulations or ISO quality standards.\nCompare GMP, food and hygiene rules and Standards from various national and international regulatory authorities and standardization organizations and be familiar with their document structure.\nApply GMP rules and ISO standards during evaluation of process design projects as well as ordinary production units,\nMaking Standard Operational Procedures (SOP)\nInterpret a Pipe & Instrumentation diagram for production process and units to identify the important details with relevance to GMP and hygiene.\nIdentify errors and imperfections of the hygienic design of pilot production plants and propose improvements.\nConstruct a written qualification report of a pilot plant unit applying practical observations, hands-on tests and calibrations, and using proper document control systems and quality management systematics.\nAnalyse quality demands and standards for utility systems (e.g air, water and steam) to be in compliance with GMP and hygienic standards.\nSelect cleaning principles and propose cleaning procedures appropriate for hygienic production plants.\nSelect and use risk management principles to evaluate strategies to achieve the desired product quality.",
    "Content": "The course comprises basic GMP requirements from international and Danish legal authorities, as well as from the international standardization organizations endorsed by the authorities. The theory also covers the life cycle of medicine products, food safety, sustainability, HACCP methods, ISO quality standards, quality management systems, document control, hygienic process design, Cleaning in Place systems and GMP compliant utilities.\nThe practical reporting of the course will contain two team rapports. One based on a practical exercise for a pilot plant CIP unit and the other report which is based on the study of a physical pilot unit. The latter report is constructed in steps during the course to generate a final comprehensive qualification and validation report for a pharmaceutical production unit using proper document control protocols.\n\nA special focus is on the science and risk based approach to GMP, the Quality by Design and Design Space concepts, used to modernize and make the pharmaceutical industry more efficient and competitive.\n\nThe teaching is a mix of lectures, problem solving, group works and practical exercises in the pilot plant To enforce the understanding of GMP as a true team effort along all professional disciplines in real life, the teams will normally be composed of students with different background and knowledge.\nPeer reviews of some group works are part of the learning and evaluation methods.\n\nA half day excursion to a pharmaceutical production plant is included. (If possible for Covid-19)",
    "Course literature": "Course Compendium + presentation slides+ problem solving notes",
    "Remarks": "Guest lecturers from industry\nThe GMP course (formerly 28855) is divided into a practical version 28857 to 7.5 ECTS, and a theoretical version 28855 to 5 ECTS.\n28857 is offered autumn semesters and 28855 spring semesters.",
