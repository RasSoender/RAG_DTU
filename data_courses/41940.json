    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course focuses on the use of remote sensing and data processing techniques in construction projects and the development of digital building models, as carriers of project information for data extraction, exchange, and communication in applications ranging from automated progress reporting to automation and robotics in construction.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nidentify sensors to measure parameters related to construction sites\nevaluate the current and the different levels of automation and robotics in construction\nanalyze and assess potentials and barriers in implementing remote sensing in building information modeling (BIM) and virtual design in construction (VDC)\nindependently find relevant and supplementary information for remote sensing techniques\ndevelop a measurement plan using remote sensing for construction applications\ninterpret and analyze captured data\ncreate as-built 3D models from point cloud data\napply and explore remote sensing techniques for observing construction site progress",
    "Content": "This course will focus on advances in digital technologies in construction. The themes to be covered are development, instrument configuration, and application of various remote sensing technologies as radio frequency identification, global navigation satellite system; 3D point cloud data capturing from ground and airborne instruments such as laser scanning, light detection and ranging, unmanned aerial vehicles, and photo-and videogrammetry. After the data collection the students will use methods in signal processing and data analysis such as filtering, noise reduction, and feature extraction for topic-relevant applications or use cases. These include construction site progress monitoring with real-time resource location sensing and tracking; as-built modeling from range point-clouds; right-time proactive construction safety, health, and wellbeing; automated or human-machine guidance and interaction; general automation and robotics applications in construction. Theoretical aspects of the harsh work environment and the complex and dynamic nature of construction site characteristics, often relevant to the success or failure of remote sensing, will also be covered.\n\nCourse activities in and outside the laboratory will explore three major areas that create challenges for embedding advanced technologies in construction projects:\n\n• Complexity, with a particular focus on the relationship of technical vs. organizational complexity.\n• Investment, with a focus on identifying and mitigating key risks from a business and process point of view.\n• Human acceptance, addressing the social and organizational intricacies caused by automation, personal rights, and intra-organizational factors.",
