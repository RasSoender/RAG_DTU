    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of this course is to provide a working knowledge of computer forensics. The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analysing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSetup a forensics investigation plan\nIdentify common places to look for evidence in common computer systems\nPreserve authenticity of evidence that may have to be used in a court case\nRecover evidence from different types of computer systems and media (e.g. files and memory)\nAnalyse evidence to provide a timeline and attribution of events\nEstablish situational awareness in the case of an ongoing security incident\nPerform forensics analysis of a compromised subsystem\nPresent the results of a forensics analysis, so that it can be used as evidence in court",
    "Content": "The course focus on the technical difficulties of identifying and recovering information from computer and communication systems, such as client computers, servers and smartphones. It will also address common techniques to analyse such information and establish situational awareness. Finally, it will address the difficulty of preserving data obtained from compromised systems, so that they can be used as evidence in court and to present facts and opinions about the data so that they can be included as expert testimony in court.\nThe syllabus includes:\n- Common computer forensics analysis tools and techniques\n- Common formats for system data and meta-data (OS structures, file systems, etc.)\n- Forensic information extraction techniques for data in memory and permanent storage\n- Core elements of legal proceedings and expert witness behaviour",
