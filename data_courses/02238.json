    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe students should develop:\n- an understanding of the principles used in biometrics algorithms and systems.\n- a knowledge of the most important biometric approaches.\n- the capability to select a suitable algorithm / system for a given application context (e.g. physical access control)\n- a good understanding of the complex relationships between biometric systems and environmental conditions (e.g. illumination, pose variations etc.) and their impact on biometric performance.\n- the capability to assess the security properties of a biometric system.\n- an understanding of data privacy principles and the impact on the design and configuration of biometric systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain concrete biometric models introduced in the course\nAnalyse the suitability of biometric models for a given scenario\nUse the biometric ingredients of existing systems to obtain a given security goal\nIndicate the potential limitations biometric ingredeints in existing systems for achieving a given security goal\nJudge the appropriateness of proposals in research papers and text books for a given application\nDesign a biometric solution for a given application scenario\nThe students should be able to achieve the above goals in a group effort while maintaining individual accountability\nThe student should be able to communicate his/her results in a clear and precise manner",
    "Content": "Authentication of individuals based on the biological and behavioural characteristics such as the face, the iris or fingerprints is a promising research domain. Biometric algorithms allow the recognition of individuals in physical or logical access control systems and thus provide an efficient and convenient alternative to knowledge based or token based systems.\n\nThe lecture covers the most important mechanisms in today's commercial biometric systems: Face recognition, iris recognition and fingerprint recognition. The course covers sensors, biometric image processing, feature extraction and classification methods. Furthermore evaluation schemes for biometric systems will be discussed such as biometric performance testing and security testing. The lecture will also map data privacy principles to the biometric system design process.\n\nThe complementary seminar extends the content of the lecture with topics on current application areas. Theses topics are researched and analysed. Specific Focus is given on applications that are specific for the European data privacy culture .\nFurthermore the seminar will discuss interoperability issues and international standardization in the field.\nThe seminar will address selected topics from current biometric research regarding 3D face recognition, biometric sample quality, multimodal biometrics and biometric template protection (e.g. www.3dface.org)",
    "Course literature": "Course literature will be indicated during the course.\n\nAdditional reading material will be provided through the teachers website:\n\nhttp://www.christoph-busch.de/teaching-biometric-systems.html",
    "Remarks": "The course is given by professor Christoph Busch from the Hochschule Darmstadt/Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphic Research (IGD) in Darmstadt, Germany",
