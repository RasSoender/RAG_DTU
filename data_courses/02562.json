    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nRendering is to use a mathematical model on a computer for creating a digital image that looks like the real three-dimensional world. Computer animation for movies and games are classical examples where rendering is essential. Visualization of architecture and products under development (digital prototypes) is another important application area. It is also an advantage to use computer graphics rendering techniques for visualizing 3D simulations or measurements. Furthermore, it is increasingly more common to generate datasets consisting of synthetic images for machine learning.\n\nThe course objective is to introduce the ray tracing techniques commonly used in computer graphics systems for general/off-line rendering (photorealistic images, material appearance modelling, computer animation, scientific visualization, mapping techniques) as well as providing some experience with developing algorithms and implementing parts of such systems. In particular, the objective is to acquaint the participants with algorithms for simulating light-material interaction and to implement parts of a graphics system that can render relatively complicated objects, scenes, and illumination conditions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nImplement ray tracing and associated Monte Carlo sampling techniques.\nImplement shaders for rendering surfaces.\nExplain and apply BRDF solutions for describing light-material interaction.\nSimulate visual effects that appear in a global illumination context (reflection, refraction, colour bleeding, caustics).\nExplain and analyze rendering techniques and choose the best suited method for a given visualization assignment.\nUse simple sampling techniques for anti-aliasing and soft shadows.\nUse texture mapping (mapping an image to a surface) to highten the level of visual detail.\nAccelerate rendering techniques using spatial data structures and graphics cards (GPU).\nUse radiometric concepts to describe how light energy is emitted, reflected, and transmitted from one surface to another.\nUse a rendering tool for physically based rendering of the appearance of a material and explain the path tracing it is based on.",
    "Content": "Visual effects: direct illumination, shadows, reflection, refraction, colour bleeding, caustics, texture.\nMethods: ray tracing, photon mapping, path tracing, texture mapping, radiosity.\nCore elements: building computer graphics systems for rendering, radiometry and photometry, light-material interaction (BRDF, BTDF), acceleration data structures, 3D projection (camera and texture), GPU acceleration.",
