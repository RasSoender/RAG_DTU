    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the participants with a fundamental knowledge about combustion and other high temperature processes, including formation and reduction of harmful emissions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSet up mass and energy balances for combustion systems\nEstimate flue gas amount and composition from stoichiometric calculations\nUse simplified and detailed chemical models to estimate combustion rate and formation of pollutant species\nCouple chemical and thermal analyses of reacting systems\nSet up simplified conservation equations for reacting flows\nExplain conceptual and practical differences between premixed and diffusion flames\nAssess the impact of turbulence on combustion rates\nSet up and use simplified model for droplet evaporation and combustion\nSet up and use simplified model for particle heating and pyrolysis\nSet up and use simplified model for char oxidation\nUse the above tools together with numerical solvers to evaluate and optimize industrial high-temperature processes",
    "Content": "The course is related to both chemical and mechanical engineering, as both of these types of engineers work with fuels and emissions. Topics covered include thermal conversion of gaseous, liquid and solid fuels (pyrolysis, gasification, combustion). Developed models are applied to practical systems, i.e., gas turbines, motors, pulverized fuel combustors, fixed bed and fluid bed, as well as related industrial high temperature processes. The content of the course is relevant for developing sustainable high temperature processes and this will be illustrated in the course. The different systems are treated theoretically and the students solve larger, practically oriented problems during the course. For non-chemical engineers, introductory material is presented at the start of the course.",
