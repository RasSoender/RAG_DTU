    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course addresses an important challenge for entrepreneurial students: Handling the challenges that come with being an entrepreneur and a student simultaneously. The purpose of this course is to understand and explore different approaches on how to organize the students' educational, entrepreneurial and person life. This will be achieved by studying e.g. students’ competency development, understanding team dynamics, planning project work, and handling conflicts in multi-disciplinary within a team. Furthermore, there is emphasis on internal and external (verbal, visual and written) communication. The students will reflect how the different tools and techniques are relevant, and can be used to improve their personal, entrepreneurial and education life (based on literature or personal experience). The learning of this course will help students to organize the rest of their MSc education in Technology Entrepreneurship.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse one’s own entrepreneurial and personal competences and plan how to develop these\nAnalyse how one’s own competences relate to the competences of a team\nDevelop multiple understandings on team dynamics and conflict management and apply them in practice\nUnderstand underlying principle on emotions that explain team dynamics and conflicts\nUnderstand how biases have an effect on team dynamics and conflicts\nDevelop different forms of communication (verbal, visual and written) within an entrepreneurial team\nDevelop different forms of communication (verbal, visual and written) used with external stakeholders\nUnderstand and develop several reflective writing techniques and apply them in the content of the course",
    "Content": "Each lecture consists of a (guest) lecture on a specific topic related to entrepreneurial life skills. The lecturer will introduce a range of approaches (e.g. concrete, abstract, theoretical, practical) on how to address this specific topic. In interactive exercises, students will explore how these different approaches can be applied to projects that they are working on at that moment in other courses. Students try out the approach, and reflect how and why this approach is working for them(or why it does not work). After the lecture, students try out a selection of approaches in more depth in their project work in other courses. Students reflect on their experiences and link these experiences to theory. Each lectures builds on the previous lecture. At the end of the course, students have tried, and reflected on, a range of approaches in entrepreneurial life skills that will guide the students throughout the rest of their MSc Education.",
