    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give an introduction to measuring techniques for determining velocity, flow, pressure, temperature etc. for fluids under stationary as well as nonstationary conditions. The course gives basic measurement theory and gives examples of physical interpretation of measurements. The course will give practical laboratory experience.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe and apply common fluid mechanical measuring methods and devices for pressure, temperature, flow and local velocity.\nidentify relevant measuring techniques for a given flow problem\nplan and execute an experiment in the laboratory\nidentify signal analysis problems and interpret results of the analysis\nmake a visualization of a flow\naccount for possible error sources in experiments and estimate an measurement uncertainty\nprocess measurement data statistically and interpret results in a fluid mechanical context\nreport an experiments in writing using scientific principles with all relevant information for a repetition of the experiment\npresent an experiment orally",
    "Content": "Transducers and systems for determining of pressure, velocity, flow and temperature. Flow visualization. Signal analysis. Data recording and processing. Error theory. The theoretical basis is illustrated through two experiments in which typical fluid mechanical measuring systems are used, such as a hot-wire anemometer and laser based methods.",
    "Remarks": "One day will take place at Ris√∏ Campus. Participants must be physically present during assigned time for experiments in the laboratory.",
