    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe students obtain a practical knowledge of planning, sampling and field analysis of soil, groundwater and air useful for investigations and risk assessment at contaminated\nsites.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPlan a field investigation at a given site in order to assess the contamination level and redox conditions including determination of relevant contamination constituents, geochemical parameters, and sampling strategy\nMake a geological description and an assessment of the hydrogeological conditions\nConduct a field investigation including correct sampling and analysis of soil, groundwater, and air\nEvaluate variation and uncertainty of data collected during field investigations\nMake an assessment of the current contamination at a specific site (delineation, composition, and source strength) and a risk assessment\nMake a flux based evaluation of contamination risk\nMake an assessment of potential remediation technologies targeting a specific contaminated site\nWrite a well-structured technical report including relevant maps showing the geological, hydrogeological and redox conditions as well as the spreading of the contamination",
    "Content": "The course consists of practical field investigations, lectures on\nselected topics and reporting (written, oral presentations):\na) Planning of field investigations at contaminated sites (soil and groundwater).\nSoil and groundwater sampling with application of different methods. PID screening of soil gas, chemical field analysis, preparation of samples for GC-analysis. Evaluation af results. Reporting of field investigations.\nb) Lectures on field investigations at contaminated sites, drilling methods, soil and\ngroundwater sampling, organic characterization of contaminated soil and groundwater, organic contamination and redox conditions in groundwater and soil gas surveys.",
    "Course literature": "Relevant course notes are handed out during the course. Course notes from course 12330 may also be used and will be available during the course.",
    "Remarks": "The course is primarily designed for master students who would like a job in consulting engineering firms or with authorities dealing with soil and groundwater contamination and as preparation for thesis/project work to specialize in soil and groundwater contamination",
