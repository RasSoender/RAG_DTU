    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main goal of the present course is to prepare a student for development of the mathematical models for a large number of the complex and realistic chemical and biotechnical problems, also involving sustainability, and for carrying out numerical solutions of such problems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nTo develop a mathematical model for description of stationary, as well as non-stationary processes, involving transport of matter and energy by convection and diffusion, as well as chemical reactions;\nTo formulate initial and boundary conditions for a mathematical problem applying relevant physical considerations;\nTo learn and to be able of working with the population balances. To set mathematical problem formulations for the systems involving the population balances. To select a solution method for such systems;\nTo apply the different discretization methods for solutions of the ordinary and partial differential equations;\nTo apply the methods for qualitative analysis and numerical solution of the coupled first order differential equations, including stiff differential equations and differential-algebraic equations;\nTo learn the analytical solution methods for the systems described by the first order hyperbolic partial differential equations;\nTo apply numerical tools for solutions of the parabolic partial differential equations; analyze steady states and stability;\nTo be capable of applying a modern programming language (presumably, Matlab or Python) for numerical solution of the practically relevant statements and for graphical analysis of the solutions.",
    "Content": "Teaching is built around a number of model examples, which broadly describe the statements of the problems with the chemical- and biotechnical contents. The problems are solved numerically, applying MATLAB as a tool. The possible typical model examples are (the choice may be different in the different years):\n\nModelling of the enzymatic hydrolyses of cellulose.\n\nModelling of the combustion processes.\n\nModelling of particle coating, with agglomeration.\n\nChromatografical separation. Linear and nonlinear isotherms\n\nMultiphase flows in porous media, including deep bed filtration and carbon dioxide underground storage.",
