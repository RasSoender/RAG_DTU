    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce the participants to the principle operation of solar heating systems and to give them knowledge of the problems surrounding the practical design of solar collectors and solar heating systems. This provides the necessary background to be able to design solar heating systems and connect these with traditional systems for domestic hot water and space heating.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDetermine the efficiency of solar collectors\nCalculate the thermal performance of solar collectors from the efficiency expression of the solar collectors\nDetermine the thermal characteristics of heat storages\nCalculate the thermal performance of solar domestic hot water systems\nExplain how solar heating systems are connected to traditional systems for hot water and space heating\nOptimize larger solar heating systems for apartment buildings\nEvaluate differently designed solar combi systems\nExplain how solar heating plants are designed\nEstimate the energy savings for solar heating systems",
    "Content": "The design and mode of operation of solar collectors, heat storages and solar heating systems. Heat balance and efficiency factors of solar collectors. Calculation and test of the efficiency of solar collectors. Thermal behaviour of heat storages. Calculation of temperatures in heat storages. Calculation and optimization of solar heating systems and exposition of conditions about the construction and design of these. Both individual and collective solar heating systems including seasonal heat storages are treated.",
