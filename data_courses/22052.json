    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give the student a solid basis for analysis and processing of analog and digital signals emanating from either deterministic or stochastic system. The major emphasize is on signal examples from the medical world, and practical introduction to analysis and processing of signals is given through computer demonstrations and exercises. The program Matlab is used for the exercises in combination with different signals from the medical word (e.g. ECG and medical ultrasound). The main emphasize is here on stochastic signals. The course contains a number of computer exercises in Matlab.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nuse common Fourier transform pairs and properties to determine the Fourier transform of complex analog and digital signals.\nrelate spectra of periodic and aperiodic analog and digital signals and plot these using correct physical units such as Hertz and Volt.\ndetermine the auto- and cross correlation functions of analog and digital random signals.\nanalyze zero-pole diagrams to determine the causality and stability of linear time-invariant systems.\nuse the z-transform to calculate the impulse response and the transfer function of a linear time-invariant system.\ndetermine the quantization errors in analog-to-digital conversion and model error sources in filters due to finite word length.\ndesign simple low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop and notch filters using pole-zero placement, simple windowing functions, filter transformation rules and the signal processing toolbox in Matlab.\nfind the power density spectra of random signals using non-parametric and parametric spectral estimation methods.\napply signal processing techniques to signals emanating from biological systems (ECG, ultrasound) and design procedures to estimate some parameters such as heart rate, blood velocity and profile of blood flow.\nin own words give examples of signal processing techniques applied in various applications such as telecommunications, radar and sonar and biomedical systems.\nCommunicate proficiently the signal processing topics in English.",
