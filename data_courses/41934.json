    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nAdvanced BIM enables you to obtain the information you need to analyze and design building systems in your professional specialization. This requires interoperability and standardization, which is why this course focuses on Open BIM data and standards. The course has three main principles: 1) Thinking in terms of 'IFC, FAIR data, and open standards', 2) Supporting the circularity of data, knowledge, processes, models, and tools, 3) Building (architect) Open BIM tools for specific use cases, applying domain expertise.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCreate and manage a BIM Execution Plan based on the OpenBIM standard ISO 19650\nIdentify, locate and extract information from an IFC model in OpenBIM tools\nApply appropriate OpenBIM standards and guidelines to support open and FAIR data, tools and processes.\nProvide professional disciplinary guidance based on OpenBIM analysis.\nApply domain specific linked data ontologies.\nCreate, fork, branch and collaborate on the development of an OpenBIM tool in Python with peers in a code repository.\nIdentify BIM challenges by analysing OpenBIM data.\nTeach an advanced BIM concept you have learned in the course to your peers and reflect on peer feedback on this.\nIdentify and model a BIM use case based on the BIM challenges identified from analysis of an OpenBIM project in BPMN.\nIdentify an appropriate development methodology for an OpenBIM tool or model to different use cases.\nApply and improve programming skills in Python to develop an OpenBIM tool or modelling skills in OpenBIM using your engineering domain expertise.\nEvaluate software licensing suitability and implications for the OpenBIM tool you develop or modelling tool you use.",
    "Content": "The course \"Advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM)\" provides the opportunity to develop skills in OpenBIM that specifically appeal to you. Perhaps you will identify a role or challenge that you wish to explore in your specialization? The course is divided into 4 parts:\n\n# Learning From BIM\nA core concept of the course is to navigate and understand the interoperable data model, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), in the AEC industry. Extract data from the IFC format. Write rules to validate the data in IFC using Python and IfcOpenShell.\n\n# OpenBIM Modeler or OpenBIM Analysis Tool Developer\nBuild an OpenBIM tool or workflow.\n\n# OpenBIM Manager or OpenBIM Ontologist\nOntologies. Linked building data.\n\n# OpenBIM Guru",
    "Remarks": "It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with Python before taking this course.",
