    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe concept of Risk is an important subject in our society. Regulatory strategies change from Prescriptive rule-based to Risk-based approaches. Our society regularly faces new and sometimes ill-understood Risks\nThe overall purpose of this course is to provide students with skills and insights for them to relate in a qualified manner to existing and future debates of risk. The objectives are 1) to enable students to undertake a simple risk assessment, 2) to outline the components and principles of a basic risk management programme, and 3) to provide students with key insights so they know some pitfalls and limitations for the application of 1) and 2).\nThis is an introductory course that favours qualitative aspects of risk management over quantitative approaches. The course introduces the student to risk-based decisions. Particularly situations where information is partial, or events with a low chance of occurrence but with unacceptably large consequence. Participants are introduced to basic methods of risk analysis, assessment and management, to a large extent illustrated by the use of practical case examples.\nThese cases draw from a diverse selection of specialist topics, e.g. industrial accident prevention, civil aviation safety, marine transport, health care, and natural disaster emergency planning and response, amongst others. The cases are selected because they illustrate or relate to theoretical views on risk that are part of curriculum. Students are expected to know the cases and understand how and why they relate to curriculum.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand and apply basic risk terminology\nExplain the difference between risk management and safety management\nRelate in a qualified manner to key propositions on how risk is generated, including, normal accident theory, the concept of a safety factor, intensification and executive failure\nExplain basic models for accident aetiology, including the Heinrich triangle and Reason's Swiss Cheese concept, drift of safety factor, and Rasmussen's SRK hierarchy\nCarry out basic incident investigation and apply key concepts such as triggers, latent and active failures and organizational processes\nApply a basic risk identification technique (SWIFT) and undertake a simple risk analysis and risk assessment\nOutline the basic components and principles of a ISO 31000 risk management programme and the textbook's barrier management approach to managing risk\nIdentify key characteristics of accident precursor analysis, explain the near-miss concept, discuss common pitfalls, and relate to the learning-from-past-mistakes approach to risk management\nDiscuss different strategies for risk management, pro et contra\nExplain the cases that are part of curriculum and explain how they relate to risk concepts and topics presented in course.\nIdentify key requirements to a good written assignment, separate theory and empirical findings, have a very basic understanding of epistemology\nRelate in a qualified manner to existing and future debates of risk",
