    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course focus on experimental techniques in biotech-relevant areas of bacteriology and molecular microbiology. In the course, you will work with both novel break-through technologies in molecular ecology, synthetic biology, and methods to utilize or control the bacterial biodiversity found in Nature.\nIn the course, you will:\n- Employ advanced tools, models and methods in molecular microbiology and ecology.\n- Critically evaluate experimental results and hypotheses.\nOverall, the course aims to provide you with competences that allow you to design, develop, use or improve bacterial systems for biotechnological applications within agricultural, marine, medical- and biomanufacturing scenarios.\nCurrently, the course is focused on microbial isolates with biocontrol or biofertilizer potential in agricultural applications",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSelect the appropriate strategy for cultivation of bacteria from environmental samples.\nIdentify microorganisms using molecular biological methods.\nDesign a screening process from e.g. isolation of a bioactive bacterium to an active compound.\nAnalyze natural microbial communities using sequence-based molecular methods.\nUse bioinformatic tools to analyze 16S rRNA sequences and other gene sequences.\nAnalyze bacterial activities and organization in microbial communities and biofilms in in vitro systems.\nUse advanced microscopy methods, including confocal microscopy.\nApply synthetic biology tools to analyze gene functions and microbial phenotypes and processes.\nApply evolutionary methods to analyze gene functions and optimize phenotypes.\nCritically evaluate, select and apply the most appropriate technique(s) in to test a hypothesis.\nPresent a method used in the course and the derived results.",
    "Content": "The course is based on active participation in laboratory exercises. This includes practical work in the laboratory, preparation before class, data processing and interpretation, presentation of results in plenum, and writing of report. It also includes obtaining the theoretical background underlying the used methods, approaches and tools from the teaching material and from the scientific literature.",
    "Course literature": "Lab manuals and scientific papers",
    "Remarks": "This is a 13-week experimental course that requires active, weekly participation. Usually there are many more students that sign up for the course than we have seats available. Therefore, only sign up for this course if you can commit to this, and if you are highly motivated by the subject.",
