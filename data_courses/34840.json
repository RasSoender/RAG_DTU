Octave and one-third octave band analyses of noise. Addition of noise from uncorrelated sound sources. The use of complex notation. Energy density, sound intensity and sound power. Impedance concepts. Plane and spherical sound waves, interference fields. Reflection and transmission of sound. Sound radiation from monopole and dipole sources, sound radiation from a piston in a baffle. Normal modes in a rectangular room. The diffuse sound field, the energy balance equation in a room and the reverberation time. Sound absorbing materials. Natural modes and resonances in simple mechanical and acoustic systems.
