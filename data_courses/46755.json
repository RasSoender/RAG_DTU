    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nElectricity markets are today central in the way we exchange electricity. The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems has a substantial and complex impact on these electricity markets. In this context, the objective of this course is to introduce the students to the fundamental aspects of renewable energy in electricity markets, from the point of view of both market operators and market participants.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the fundamentals of electricity markets\nExplain various markets, actors, and pricing mechanisms\nExplain the market-clearing process from both optimization and equilibrium perspectives\nDescribe the impact of renewables on electricity markets\nDevelop mathematical models including optimization and equilibrium problems for clearing various electricity markets\nDesign mathematical models for market participants enabling them to make optimal offering strategy decisions under uncertainty\nImplement some of these mathematical models in Julia or Python\nPresent, analyze, and interpret the numerical results",
    "Content": "Introduction\n\nFundamentals of electricity markets\n- Supply and demand curves and the merit-order principle\n- Definitions of social welfare and equilibrium\n- Various pricing mechanisms\n- Various electricity markets\n- Various market actors\n- European versus US electricity markets\n- The market-clearing problem as an optimization problem\n\nMarket clearing: optimization versus equilibrium\n- The market-clearing problem as a competitive equilibrium problem\n- Definitions of Nash equilibrium and mixed complementarity problem\n\nDay-ahead market\n- The day-ahead market in practice (focus on Nord Pool)\n- The market-clearing problem as an optimization problem\n- Verification of the market-clearing price using KKT optimality conditions\n- Network effects: Zonal versus nodal market clearing\n\nIntra-day and balancing markets\n- Markets in practice (focus on Nordic markets)\n- The market-clearing problem as an optimization problem\n- One-price versus two-price balancing settlements\n\nAncillary service markets\n- Ancillary markets in practice (focus on European and Nordic markets, such as mFRR, aFRR, FCR, FCR-N, and FCR-D)\n- The market-clearing problem as an optimization problem\n\nImpacts of renewables in electricity markets\n\nOffering strategy of a price-taker wind power producer\n- Price-taker versus price-maker actor\n- Offering strategy as a newsvendor problem\n- Offering strategy under uncertainty via stochastic programming\n- Risk considerations\n- Decision quality analysis: Ex-post out-of-sample and cross validation analysis\n\nOffering strategy of stochastic flexible assets in ancillary service markets\n- Pre-qualifications to bid in in ancillary service markets\n- Chance-constrained programming and solution techniques\n- A chance-constrained optimization model for offering strategy",
    "Remarks": "- You can find lecture slides and example of programming-based assignments from last years here: https://www.jalalkazempour.com/teaching\n- The evaluation will be based on group reports for course assignments. Therefore, group management skills are necessary. Students are responsible of forming their groups.",
