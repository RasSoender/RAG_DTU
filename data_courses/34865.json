    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIntroduce numerical methods used in Acoustics: Finite Element Method (FEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM). Enable the students to define and create numerical models of acoustical devices and setups, couple them to mechanical models, and draw conclusions from the results.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSelect the appropriate numerical tool for any given acoustic problem: FEM, BEM or a combination of them.\nDefine the model to contain the relevant features, excluding unnecessary details.\nFormulate and construct numerical simulations in acoustics using FEM and BEM.\nIdentify the boundary conditions and, if appropriate, define the coupling properties.\nAssemble a FEM model based on weighted residuals, Galerkin’s method.\nEvaluate the particularities of the BEM direct collocation formulation, such as singular and near-singular integrals.\nDefine and solve multidomain problems in BEM.\nDefine and solve FEM/BEM coupling.\nAnalyze simulation results and draw conclusions from them.",
    "Content": "The course focuses on theoretical lectures combined with computer exercises using Matlab programming. The students will use and adapt existing BEM and FEM code in Matlab. The Comsol FEM package may also be used.\nThe formulation of the FEM and BEM in acoustics will be examined and developed with practical programming examples related with acoustical problems. There will be short exercises in connection with the theory, plus a larger assignment during the course that will be evaluated in the oral exam.\nThe coupling of the acoustic model with other elements in the setup defined in different physical terms, such as mechanical systems, will be outlined.",
