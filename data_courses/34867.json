    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course objective is to let students work with current and realistic acoustic issues present at the Roskilde festival. Furthermore the aim is to enable the participants to evaluate possible solutions and describe this in a report to a client/customer, being the Roskilde festival.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse the acoustic problems in real case\nDescribe and classify the importance of different reasons of the acoustic problems\nPlan and perform an acoustic measurement on a music festival\nInvestigate an acoustic problem via simulation\nEvaluate the results of the investigation\nEvaluate the effect of suggested improvements\nDocument the work in a scientific report\nPresent (orally) the results of the project improvement",
    "Content": "In the annual Roskilde music festival, it is essential to have good acoustic conditions, in a wide sense. The course is in the form of a project. In collaboration with the festival organizer the student will identify acoustic problems, investigate these and come up with suggestions for solutions. The project should typically contain both theoretical and experimental parts.",
    "Remarks": "Contact the teacher for current projects\nStudents who are following the M.Sc. programme in Engineering Acoustics and have already passed or is currently signed up for on of the courses: 34850, 34860, 34870 (previously 31220,31240,31260) will be accepted on the course before other students.",
