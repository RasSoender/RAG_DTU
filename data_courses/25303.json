    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course is an introduction to mathematical modelling of biological systems. It will enable the student to evaluate, develop and apply simple dynamical population models.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPresent and discuss a mathematical model for an audience of peers.\nProgram numerical solutions of ODEs occurring in mathematical biology\nDevelop and discuss differential equation models occurring in mathematical biology.\nUse general arguments to assess the size and variability of fertility, mortality, and migration in real populations, and their importance in models.\nAssess characteristic levels and time scales in population dynamic models.\nArgue for choice of parameter values in a model applied in a specific biological context.\nDetermine which model structure is appropriate to answer a given question related to, e.g., resource management, risk assessment, or evaluation of SDGs.\nUtilize population models to answer such questions.",
    "Content": "The course is an introduction to mathematical modelling of population dynamics of living organisms, from bacteria to whales. Focus is on conceptual models based on differential and difference equations that illustrate basic concepts in population modelling. An important goal is to develop the ability to connect a biological context to an abstract mathematical model, i.e., to develop an understanding of the biological assumptions underlying the model and the ecological consequences of its results.\nThe main topics are:\nSingle-species population models (logistic growth),\nMulti-species models (competition and predator-prey relations),\nFunctional responses, Somatic growth modelling.\nExploitation of living systems,\nSeasonal succession,\nEpidemiological models, and\nSpatial population dynamics.\n\nFurther basic concepts from evolutionary dynamics are introduced. Some emphasis is on the development and evaluation of the presentation skills of the students. In the last part of the course, the students develop their own projects, which will be evaluated by a poster session.",
