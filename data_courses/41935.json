    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nSuper-light structures and pearl-chain reinforcement, sandwich arches and element cupolas are new concrete structures invented at DTU Construct.\nThey open possibilities for new shapes of building structures and for reducing the price and resource consumption to less than the half of that of usual structures of concrete and steel.\nThe course aims to give the participants competences to understand, design and calculate super-light structures and participate in the development of their details, components and architectural expressions.\nYou learn how to create an optimal and possible force distribution and to design a structure for it, instead of first designing a structure and then finding the forces in it.\nIn addition, the course gives competence in establishing calculation models and identifying critical matters for a design, which is important for engineering work at the early phases of a building project.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndesign a minimal super-light structure\nexplain how the behavior of a super-light structure supports resource optimization\nevaluate the behavior of a pearl-chain reinforcement\nidentify critical load cases for a given structural design\napply calculation models to a super-light structure and calculate the load-bearing capacity\nanalyze how architecture can support minimal super-light structures\nassess the price and resource consumption of a structure\nassess the constructability of a super-light structure\ncreate and present a design by a movie or 3D pictures and a brief report",
    "Content": "At first, the technology and idea is introduced. Then, the participants define different tasks for their project work.\nIt could be development of a prefabricated beam, column, a connection detail, a bridge, a hall, an architectural expression of a building or calculation tools, new combinations of materials etc.\nThe results are visualized and presented",
    "Course literature": "Course book, papers, reports, and student work on the subject plus common technical literature",
    "Remarks": "The course is a general competence course at the Master in Architectural Engineering.",
