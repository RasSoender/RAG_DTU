    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with a fundamental and practically applicable understanding of industrial important types of reactions and reactors that can be used in chemical and biochemical production processes and in pollution control.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ncharacterize solid particulates with respect to size, size distribution, shape, porosity, texture etc.\ncalculate effective diffusion coefficients in simple structures.\nestablish and solve mathematical models for gas-solid reactions (transport phenomena coupled to chemical reactions)\nevaluate structure models for gas-solid reactions.\nestablish and solve models for gas-liquid-solid reactions.\nexplain the enhancement factor for gas-liquid reactions.\nanalyse and simplify complicated reaction engineering problems in order to establish mathematical models for the main phenomena.\nevaluate calculations for reaction engineering problems in order to use the results for practical design.",
    "Content": "A major part of chemical reactions in production processes and in gas cleaning processes takes place in multi-phase reactors, e.g. Production of Pharmaceuticals, calcination of lime in the production of calcium hydroxide, production of cement, combustion of solid and liquid fuels in the production of power and heat, catalytic and non-catalytic cleaning of flue gas and catalytic production of important products in different reactors including two or more phases. The examples are homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysed, gas-solid, gas-liquid, liquid-solid and gas-liquid-solid reactions that take place in a number of different reactor types (batch fixed bed, moving bed, spray absorbers, packed towers, membrane reactors, fluidized bed reactors, entrained flow reactors etc.). The theory covering the different types of reactions and a number of the reactors is expounded together with examples. During the semester the students cooperate in teams solving practical oriented reactor design problms.",
