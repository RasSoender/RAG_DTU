    "Scope and form": "Classroom lectures / discussions / presentations / project\nApplies project-oriented problem-based learning: Every week 50% of the time will be for lecture/invited talks and 50% for applying various theories and methods towards achieving the project goals. The lecture and group activities are blended in the form of studio teaching.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E3A",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and reports\nThe final report is a description, analysis and reflection on the process of developing a new learning technology as a product or service, with reference to the relevant theories and principles. 2-4 person groups (can be done alone as well) will hand in a report. There will be two parts of the oral exam, which altogether be 30 min per person including assessment and feedback. The first part will include a group presentation in the form of a startup pitch followed by a discussion. The second part will include an individual oral exam regarding the role played in the group as an entrepreneur/intrapreneur and learning from the course.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn this course, you will learn how to use technology for learning and about different theories on how we learn. As part of the course, you, along with your group, will design - and perhaps build - a digital learning technology.\n\nYou will also learn how to leverage the different types of data generated by digital learning technologies and how the insights from the analyses of data can help students learn more or improve the learning experience & outcomes, teachers become better at teaching, scientists doing their research more evidence-based and developers to produce more efficient technologies.\n\nThis course is for you if you want to:\n* Understand how we learn and how we can improve learning\n* Understand how to create evidence of learning\n* Know more about how to become an entrepreneur\n* Improve teaching and learning using technology\n* Make learning more effective, deeper and more fun\n* Build valuable digital learning technology for individual and organization\n* and maybe revolutionize teaching and learning",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the use of digital learning technologies as a way to support teaching and learning\nExplain theories of how to develop efficient and engaging digital learning and teaching technologies.\nApply theories and methods from a range of the cross disciplinary field of digital learning technology design in the development of their learning technology. For example: learning theories, learning design theories, learning analytics, data mining, interaction design, game design, user experience and entrepreneurial thinking\nDesign a digital learning technology as a concept and/or a digital prototype\nCreate a design using relevant qualitative and quantitative methods and carry out one or more small-scale co-design processes with users (for example learners, instructors or management) when developing the learning technology\nCreate a design using relevant qualitative and quantitative research methods and - if possible - carry out a test of the learning technology with users (for example learners, instructors or management), in order to create evidence for the developed technology\nCommunicate ideas and technical aspects in a clear and concise form\nPitch the digital learning technology as a simple business model",
    "Content": "Topics covered are:\n* Digital learning technology\n* Learning theory and learning design\n* Interaction design, design thinking and prototyping\n* Inspirational talks from experts and learning technology (EdTech) startups\n* User experience and user involvement\n* Analytical methods and research design\n* Learning analytics\n* Educational data mining\n* Entrepreneurship\n* Make your own digital learning technology - Project work including: Feedback from experts, Talks by former students, Need for specific digital technology aspects, student pitches",
    "Course literature": "• This course is structured according to the interaction/service design process. See for inspiration - Preece, Jenny, Yvonne Rogers, and Helen Sharp. “Chapter 2 The Process of Interaction Design.” In Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction, Fourth edition., 87–133. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, 2019. Additional materials will be available on DTU's learning management system and accessible through DTU library database access.\n• The course literature mainly consists of scientific papers and book chapters from the fields of learning and communication, interaction design, service design, data science, and entrepreneurship. See, for instance, a research paper on motivation theory. See Figure 1 (p.61): Ryan, Richard M., and Edward L. Deci. “Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations: Classic Definitions and New Directions.” Contemporary Educational Psychology 25, no. 1 (January 2000): 54–67.",
