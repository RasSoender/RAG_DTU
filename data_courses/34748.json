    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce students to a function modelling methodology (Multilevel Flow Modelling) to analyze operational problems in complex industrial plants including diagnosis and decision support. The course demonstrates knowledge based systems for diagnosis, planning and design from a plant-wide perspective.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyze the design of a complex automation system\nDecompose automation and control hierarchies\nSpecify goals and means of plant operation\nSpecify control tasks and operation procedures\nDevelop Multilevel Flow Models (MFM) for industrial problems\nApply MFM models for diagnosis and action planning\nPlan and execute projects\nWrite a technical report, including references and citations",
    "Content": "The primary goal of the course is for students to learn a modelling method that has the potential to support complex system operation. On the generic level, all form of modelling activities happens in two steps. The first step is \"Interpretation\", when the modeller acquires knowledge and principles of the modelled subject; and the second step is \"Representation\", when the modeller reconstructs the knowledge in a pre-defined formal language, i.e. to build a “model” that mimic the behaviour of the modelled subject. The course will be conducted following this general modelling framework, by firstly introducing the features of the complex engineered systems and the challenges in their daily operation. The students shall learn to analyze the design and control of these systems and specify the operation goals and functions. The course will then introduce the theory and method of functional modelling and its application (implementation of knowledge systems) to support complex plant operation. The students shall learn to build function models and use the model to analyze plant operation scenarios.",
