    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nWith the point of departure in economic theory the purpose is to provide the students with a fundamental understanding of the current situation and the dynamic challenges that lie ahead for the energy sector both nationally and internationally. This includes an understanding of energy economics, energy markets, politics, regulation and resources. The theoretical basis of the course is the economic theories relevant for those topics. Furthermore, the students are expected to relate these elements to the term sustainability. The energy policy instruments will be compared in relation to different policy objectives and institutional settings in the energy sector. The students are expected to develop competences in interpreting, explaining and discussing the challenges of the energy sector, policy and regulation from an economic perspective.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain and apply basic concepts of economic theory such as demand and supply , general equilibrium and markets\nDescribe a country’s energy structure and apply relevant indicators to compare it with other countries\nIdentify and explain the dynamic interactions between energy markets,and describe the role of institutional and organisational relationships in energy markets\nAnalyse power markets based on load duration curves, screening curves and cost recovery of power plants\nDescribe the relation between investments and generation capacity and the effects produced by capacity remunerations models such as capacity markets\nModel interactions within power markets depending on competitive structure\nAssess compare and anslyse the effects and interactions between different regulation methods\nAnalyse and compare the consequences of different support schemes and auction mechanisms on renewable energy technologies investment\nDescribe the regulatory and policy choices for unbundling and energy networks regulation\nAnalyze energy demand and electricity load patterns and how the affect energy systems\nApply quantitative methods for energy economics analysis",
    "Content": "This course takes the approach of microeconomics to analyse the energy sector, how energy markets behave and the necessary regulation of markets.\nThe course provides a general introduction to the energy sector both at the national and at the international level. The main focus will be on different types of energy markets (electricity, oil, gas, emissions, etc.). This encompasses market design, market interactions as well as potential market imperfections. These subjects will be analysed and discussed under consideration of environmental taxes, quantitative regulation and market power. We discuss policy measures to address these aspects under different conditions.\nTextbook chapters as well as scientific papers and articles dealing with the respective subject will be introduced and discussed.\n\nThe course applies an equality policy with no discrimination of gender, age, religious beliefs or disabilities.",
    "Course literature": "For students that have no previous experience regarding microeconomic theory, please watch the MIT courseware - Lecture Videos | Principles of Microeconomics | Economics | MIT\nLecture 1-12\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2018/video_galleries/lecture-videos/\n\nGregory Mankiw, Principles of Microeconomics, Chapter 6 – 10\n\nStoft \"Power System Economics\" (2003).Ch 1-4, and 1-6 - Ch 1-8, 2-1\n\nStudents with no previous knowledge of power systems economics should get familiar with it using Weber, Fichtner, Möst, \"Economics of Power Systems.",
