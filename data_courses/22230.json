    "course title": "22230 Development and production of vaccines",
    "Danish title": "Udvikling og produktion af vacciner",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nOffered as a single course\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering",
    "Schedule": "Spring F4A (Tues 13-17)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The course is conducted as a combination of lectures and group work. An excursion to SSI will be planned. Relevant guest lecturers will attend selected topics.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Type of assessment": "Evaluation of exercises/reports\nThe exam consists of two individual interim quizzes and a final written group report with individualization and an oral presentation. The grade is based on an overall assessment, with each quiz accounting for 20% and the final report with the oral presentation accounting for 60%. To pass the course, all part-exams must be completed. Illness or arranged absence from a part exam will allow for an extra part exam. No-shows in part-exams without prior arrangement with the lecturer will result in an incomplete part-exam and a failed course.",
    "Exam duration": "Each quiz is 60 minutes at the start of teaching in lesson 6 or 7 and lesson 13.",
    "Aid": "All Aids - with access to the internet",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , internal examiner",
    "Previous Course": "24102 and 27324",
    "Academic prerequisites": "27322/27070 , The teaching will only briefly cover the cellular and humoral elements of the immune system and how the immune system reacts to infection. Thus it is a prerequisite that the student is already familiar with these elements of basic immunology or achieves this knowledge in parallel e.g. by taking the course in immunology (27070).",
    "Responsible": "Peter M. H. Heegaard , Lyngby Campus, Building 202, Ph. (+45) 3588 6241 , PMHH@dtu.dk",
    "Department": "22 Department of Health Technology",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will deal with the challenges connected with the design, development, production and registration of vaccines based on knowledge of the immune system in human and animals. Therapeutic antibodies will also be taught. The students will acquire knowledge on vaccines for the treatment or prevention of infections, allergies, cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. The students will understand the capacities and complexities of using the vaccinated host’s own immune system as both the target and the final executor of the desired effects of the drug. This biopharma approach to viewing vaccines as drugs is beneficial for understanding their discovery and production and also their use for preventive, therapeutic and post-exposure applications.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the basic nature of different vaccine types (live, inactivated, killed, subunit etc.).\nexplain the different methods available for antigen discovery and production.\nexplain the method of action for adjuvants.\ndesign the construct of a vaccine with selection of antigen, adjuvant and delivery.\ndesign vaccine characteristics for a given application in practice, including the interplay with diagnostic assays.\ndescribe general principles for toxicology and hazard identification.\nexplain the safety and efficacy aspects of vaccines and how these are tested.\nexplain how to use, empower and produce immunoglobulins as one class of biopharmaceuticals.\ndescribe the principle governing preclinical and clinical testing of vaccines.\ndesign vaccines against allergy.\ndesign vaccines against cancer.\napply the knowledge obtained in the course to describe the development of a new vaccine or therapeutic antibody against a selected topic.",
    "Content": "This course will teach basic vaccinology such as different types of vaccine, administration of vaccines, and the immunology behind vaccine and adjuvant effects and explain some of the practical considerations behind using vaccines in humans and animals. Fundamental concepts in toxicology and hazard identification will be taught. Special considerations in vaccination against infections, cancer, or in the treatment of allergy will also be taught.\n\nAs an example of drug development and production, the process of developing and producing vaccines will be taught, from the definition of an antigen with the optimal characteristics of ease of production, stability and immunological relevance through the selection and/or development of adjuvants and testing in animals, to the final production and formulation of a vaccine for a specific use. This also includes requirements from authorities in the approval of a vaccine production and preclinical and clinical testing of vaccines. Finally, design and production of therapeutic antibodies will be taught.",
    "Course literature": "There is no individual textbook that covers the development of vaccines in the same way as the course. Relevant scientific articles will be used along with other shared material.\nFor general background and reference, it is necessary to have access to a text book in general immunology such as Janeway's Immunobiology, which is also used in course 27070.",
