    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students insight into the mathematical description of measurements (laboratory, observatory, satellite and field data) and their application to the study of astrophysical and geophysical systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nfind suitable representations/parametrizations of data and models\nclassify inverse problems\nsolve linear inverse problems with analytical methods\nexamine how noise on the data propagates into uncertainty on the solutions\nuse prior information in solving an inverse problem\nuse methods to avoid instability in numerical solution methods\nperform a Fourier analysis of data that are non-uniform distributed\nsolve weakly non-linear problems with iterative methods based on linearization.",
    "Content": "The course deals with methods for data representation and quality assessment, parameterization of physical systems, description of empirical and analytical relationships between data and model parameters, stochastic description of uncertainties and noise, and stochastic and deterministic quantification of prior knowledge about a physical system.\n\nA number of analytical/numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear inverse problems are presented. The propagation of noise in the data to uncertainty of the solutions is a major theme in the course.",
