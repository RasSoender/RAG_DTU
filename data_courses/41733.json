    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe students will learn to understand relations between metallurgy, design, casting processes, thermal conditions and properties of cast metal components.\nThe students will learn fundamental design rules and construction of production lay-outs.\nThe course focus on fundamental metallurgy related to solidification of metals aimed at experimental and theoretical analysis of casting processes. Solidification metallurgy is taught as a generic discipline and can be used in other processes such as welding and 3D metal print, too.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDesign cast components\nSelect the right combination material and process for manufacture of cast components\nDescribe how design and casting process determine final properties of a cast component\nUse fundamental models to analyse the physical and chemical processes that take place when metals solidify\nUse fundamental mathematical models to analyse the thermal and physical processes that take place in metal and mould in the casting process\nCarry out simple analytical modelling/analysis of heat transfer in castings\nBe able to dimension feeding and gating systems for castings\nAnalyse castings and describe the physical phenomena that leads to defects in castings\nUse process modelling software to analyse casting processes",
    "Content": "Lectures: Casting and welding metallurgy - nucleation and solidification, formation of microstructures and heat treatment; Process technology - important casting processes, calculation of gating and feeding sytems, desing of lay-outs; Heat transfer - simple analytical solutions, Chvorinovs rule, casting in permanent moulds; Design of castings - tolerances, dimensioning, complex geometries, die and pattern design.\nExercises: are closely related to the lectures and gives the students an opportunity to learn some of the fundamental issues that are dealt with in the theory.",
