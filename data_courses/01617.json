    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo be able to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems and understand their complexity. Many models in science and engineering are differential equations describing the evolution of some variables. Dynamical systems theory is the study of such evolution aiming to answer questions like: What is the long term dynamics? How does the system depend on parameters? These are very important questions in applications and hence dynamical systems theory is a very important topic in science and engineering. Dynamical systems is also a fascinating field of mathematics as it combines most of the core mathematical disciplines, in particular, analysis and geometry.\nThe course will lay the mathematical foundation for the following more advanced courses: 01257 Advanced Modelling - Applied Mathematics, where the students get to apply dynamical systems theory to concrete problems in modelling\n01621 Advanced Dynamical Systems: Global Theory\n01622 Advanced Dynamical Systems with Applications in Science and Engineering",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDetermine phase portraits for linear ordinary differential equations.\nAnalyze stability in systems.\nDetermine and exploit hyperbolicity in the analysis of equilibrium points.\nOperate with stable, unstable and center manifolds.\nTopological equivalence and index theory.\nApply Poincaré-Bendixon theorem and other results to decide the existence of limit cycles.\nClassify local bifurcations in general and find the possible local bifurcations in a specific system.\nApply Hartman-Grobman theorem about linearisation to give a qualitative description of the dynamics in a vicinity of a hyperbolic equilibrium.\nCombine the aforementioned points to give a global phase portrait of certain dynamical systems.\nPoincaré maps and chaos.",
    "Content": "Phase portraits of linear systems. Stability analysis including the Hartman-Grobman theorem. Stable, unstable and center manifolds. Local bifurcation theory. Theory of planar systems including Poincaré-Bendixon theorem. The mathematical techniques will be applied to problems from physics, chemistry, and biology.",
