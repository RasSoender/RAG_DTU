    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim is to obtain an understanding of the processing mechanisms in the auditory system and the perceptual consequences. To learn about functional relationships between the physical attributes of sound and their associated percepts, using a system's approach. To study sensory and brain processing, and their locations, using objective methods such as otoacoustic emissions and auditory evoked potentials. To learn about potential clinical and technical applications by applying auditory-model based processing techniques.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe and apply basic signal analysis concepts (e.g., convolution, correlation, Fourier transform, sampling, quantization, aliasing).\ncategorize different types of hearing impairments and their perceptual consequences, and evaluate potential compensation strategies in modern hearing aids and cochlear implants.\ninterpret the concepts of signal detection theory and explain their implications for psychophysical measurement methods.\nanalyze the processing of sound in the inner ear (cochlea), predict the features of cochlear transformation using an electrical circuit (PSpice)\ncharacterize the auditory system’s frequency selective properties, demonstrate the concept of masking, and evaluate models of auditory masking\nexplain the auditory system’s properties of temporal processing, calculate the modulation spectrum of a stimulus, and evaluate the concept of modulation-frequency selective processing\ndiscuss methods to measure loudness and intensity discrimination; evaluate models of loudness and intensity coding in the auditory system\ndemonstrate and discuss the principles of spatial and binaural hearing; predict binaural perception data using an equalization-cancellation model\nrelate speech intelligibility performance to the properties of stimulus, room acoustics and state of hearing; compare and evaluate different methods for the measurement of speech intelligibility\ndiscuss models of signal processing in auditory neurons, evaluate physiologically inspired models of auditory perception\nexplain methods for measuring otoacoustic emissions and acoustically evoked brain potentials; categorize different types of evoked potentials; interpret the role of cochlear processing for the generation of brainstem potentials",
    "Content": "Psychophysics and physiology of the auditory system. Models of auditory signal processing and perception. Neurophysiological measuring methods. Relation between neurophysiological measurements and psychoacoustical (behavioral) findings. Neural imaging techniques. Technical and clinical applications. Compensation strategies in modern hearing aids and cochlear implants. There are classroom-based problem-solving sets and seven Matlab-based exercises that complement some of the lectures in the course.",
    "Remarks": "E-learning is used in the form of online and interactive quizzes, video recorded lectures, course wiki open for user input, discussion board or blog, web based tools as well as a digital whiteboard. Students that plan to take 22006 Acoustic Communication, should do so before this course, not after.",
