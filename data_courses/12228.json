    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDo a basic assessment of health affecting air pollutants like particulate matter, ground level ozone and NO2 in urban air.\nExplain basic concepts of air pollution, and identify and solve environmental problems with emphasis on air pollution.\nApply working knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering science in understanding air pollution, and possible environmental engineering interventions.\nSketch political and economic actors in relation to solving air pollution problems in the urban sphere.\nRelate health and safety needs in relation to air pollutants.\nAnalyse, interpret, and communicate environmental data related to urban air pollution\nDesign air sampling methods and air pollution measurements campaigns.\nPerform relevant measurements of key air pollutants.\nEvaluate key air pollutants - and their environmental impact - from important sectors like residential burning, shipping, agriculture, road traffic etc.\nAssess the effect of possible preventive measures such as green infrastructure and catalytic conversion of gases in the urban environment",
    "Content": "Air pollution is a phenomenon that has increased both in geographical and temporal measure since the start of civilization. The course provides a short introduction to the historical background and outlines the problem as seen in a general perspective. The course treats air pollution from sources through atmospheric transport and transformation, deposition and impacts on humans in the urban environment. Specific air pollutants covered in the course include NOx, O3, fine particles and ultra fine particles. The course covers measurement of air pollutants and understanding of human health effects and its interaction with other variables. Technological means for regulating air pollution in the urban environment are described. Finally environmental economy, legislation and international efforts towards reduced emissions are briefly covered.",
