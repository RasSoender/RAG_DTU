    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nwork professionally in student-selected teams and on group-selected product ideas\nconduct analyses and orientations around a product which has a potential for market development\nperform a thorough design of the product following the 4-stage methodology (needs-specification-concept generation-selection) from 28311\napply computer-aided design methods for product development\napply computational and technical skills in all phases of product design\nanalyse market needs and product prospects in a local or global market environment\nbe innovative in generation of product concepts for design based on own-selected product ideas\nevaluate a product in relation to the 17 UN sustainability goals",
    "Content": "This course is based on the knowledge acquired in the prerequisite course 28311. New elements include market analysis and computer-aided product design.\n\nDuring the course you work in teams which are formed by the students themselves. The teams choose their own product idea and each team is assigned one mentor who can guide during the design process. A group report with individual sections is the basis of the evaluation.\n\nYou will work with all elements mentioned in 28311 in your own product idea and in addition market analysis and emphasis on including quantitative elements in many parts of the design process e.g. via computer-aided design aspects.",
