    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIndustrial companies experience an increasing demand from customers for customized products with approximately the same delivery time and price as mass produced products. Mass Customization is the production of customized products by using the advantages of mass production. The basic principles of Mass Customization are the module structuring of the company’s product range and application of product configuration systems in the customer-oriented business processes. The general aim of the course is to enable students to understand the principles of Mass Customization, and to develop and digitalise a company’s customer-oriented specification processes operationally, analyse and model the company’s product range, and structure and implement a product configuration system.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAnalyse and develop a company’s specification processes. Increase digitalization by using product configuration systems.\nAnalyse and model a company’s product range by using a product variant master.\nStructure a product model by using UML modelling techniques.\nApply the principles of Mass Customization and evaluate how relevant they are to a concrete company.\nApply the principles of product modularisation and the business incentives for using product modularisation.\nUse the basic principles of expert systems and the ways of reasoning of the product configuration systems.\nSelect a standard configuration system in relation to a company’s concrete requirements.\nApply the principles of systems for product data management (product data management (pdm) systems/product life cycle management (plm) systems). Methods and principles for digitalisation of sales and engineering processes.",
    "Content": "The course contains two major assignments. The first assignment, to hand in end of October, contains working out a conceptual configuration model of a product and implementation of this model in a standard configuration system. The specification processes for working out quotes for customers and specifications for production are modeled. A conceptual configuration model is elaborated by using a product variant master, and a formal IT model is made based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) and by use of Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) cards. The User Interface is defined, and the model is implemented in a standard configuration system.\nThe second assignment will be handed in at the end of the course, and contains an analysis of a company’s specification processes, and development of suggested ways to improve these processes through digitalization and automatization. The assignment focuses on Configure to Order processes supported by configurators and Engineer to Order processes for handling special products.",
