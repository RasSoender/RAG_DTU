    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students a detailed knowledge of modern mobile communication systems. This course builds on the knowledge acquired in 34330 “Introduction to mobile communication”, but the focus here is on the backhaul network, i.e., the network connecting the base stations to the core network and the Internet. Also more advanced topics in the radio access network will be covered.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEvaluate requirements to mobile backhaul networks and assess the backhaul’s impact on coverage and capacity\nDefine design criteria for mobile network deployments\nDesign backhaul networks (dimensioning and choice of technology)\nEstimate load and capacity requirements in mobile networks and based upon this carry out dimensioning of mobile backhaul\nDefine requirements to synchronization, resilience and security\nExplain how protocols, capacity and technologies impact mobile applications\nDesign backhaul for special applications, e.g., small-cells, relays, inter cell coordination and Cloud-RAN\nComprehend advanced literature in the field of mobile communication",
    "Content": "Mobile backhaul networks:\nTopologies, wire-less and wire-line backhaul technologies, capacity, load and dimensioning, fronthaul and backhaul, mobile access and aggregation networks, synchronization, resilience, Quality of service, security. Protocols, protocol stacks and protocol overheads.\nLTE/LTE-A/5G mobile network radio access (5G multi RIT):\nProviding coverage and capacity. Macro/micro/pico/femto cells. Special antennas, remote radio heads, cloud-RAN and open-RAN. Interference mitigation techniques.",
