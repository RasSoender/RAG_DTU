    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nGeneral competence course (MSc), Wind Energy\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Sustainable Energy\nProgramme specific course (MSc), Wind Energy\nProgramme-specific course (MSc), Sustainable Energy Technologies\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Sustainable Energy",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E2B (Thurs 8-12)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "Lectures with discussion and short in-class exercises (e.g. written derivations); mandatory computational assignments drive the assessment and hands-on learning.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E2B",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and exercises\nThe grade is based on an overall assessment based on mandatory assignments, together with the oral examination.",
    "Aid": "No Aid",
    "Evaluation": "7 step scale , internal examiner",
    "Academic prerequisites": "Need to know/use undergraduate mathematics including differential & integral calculus with vectors & complex numbers (e.g. DTU 01005 & 01901). Some basic fluid mechanics/dynamics is also used and thermodynamics is a bonus. Experience with programming in Matlab, Python, Mathematica, or similar—equivalent to e.g. 02631/02633, in order to do the assignments.",

    "Department": "46 Department of Wind and Energy Systems",
    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give a general and usable understanding of atmospheric flow/physics and statistics relevant for wind energy, including turbulence and wind resources",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply simple statistical concepts in the description of time series of the wind; e.g. means, moments, and probability density functions\nAnalyze meteorological time series using more advanced statistical tools, such as the correlation function, spectra and cross-spectra\nExplain the basic mechanisms responsible for winds in the atmosphere\nExplain and use the atmospheric boundary layer [ABL] and surface-layer concepts, along with the limitations/requirements of surface-layer theory\nExplain how atmospheric stability and the Coriolis force affect the ABL and wind flow\nQuantitatively use micrometeorological concepts such as roughness length, momentum flux, Obukhov length, and the geostrophic drag law\nQualitatively explain how various kinds of non-uniformity in terrain affect the atmospheric flow\nApply the above-mentioned concepts to estimate the wind energy resource over simple terrain\nQuantitatively characterize atmospheric turbulence, via variances, spectra and coherences; explain the connection to dynamic loads on structures\nCharacterize the most commonly used in-situ and remote sensors of wind\nExplain wind-related aspects of the IEC 61400-1 standard for wind turbine safety",
    "Content": "The course is an introduction to the atmospheric physics and associated basic statistical analysis relevant to wind energy. It deals with the atmospheric boundary layer, including stability, roughness and topography, mean winds, and extreme wind statistics. It also involves turbulence and gusts; description of these includes spectra, coherence and probability density functions. Sources of wind data are reviewed; wind resources and their assessment, as well as site assesment and the IEC standard are covered. The course material is primarily a book of notes (PDF-file), with interactive lecture at the chalkboard also involving some in-class exercises (derivations) and including supplementary slides. The course is assignment-driven; numerical programming (e.g. Python, MatLab, Mathematica) is needed to conduct the assignments.",
    "Course literature": "Text/Notes are provided.",
    "Remarks": "Please note the pre-requisites: if you are not ready to use upper-level undergraduate calculus and do not have any experience using a scientific/engineering programming framework like MatLab (or python, Mathematica, R, etc.), then this course will demand more time than its 5 ECTS rating.",
