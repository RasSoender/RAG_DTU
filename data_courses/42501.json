    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to equip students with key competencies regarding innovation in engineering.\nStudents will:\n\n- Understand how to apply an innovation process to a real-life engineering challenge\n- Experience the big picture of the innovation landscape by learning to navigate their role in it\n- Contribute to innovation initiatives in team context\n- Collaborate in facilitated innovation methods\n- Acquire the signature DTU mindset and approach to innovation\n- Be able to communicate to relevant stakeholders\n- Acquire a toolkit of methods to structure innovation\n- Create new solution-oriented ideas and mature these to a final concept proposal",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the importance of and relationship between Feasibility, Viability, Desirability, Responsibility and Sustainability of an innovation solution\nExplain the innovation process through the chosen model of the 'Double Diamond'\nExplain the different approaches in the innovation landscape defined in the DTU School of Innovation\nExplain methods of working in the different stages of an innovation process e.g., exploration, ideation, iteration, designing, and building\nApply an innovation process model in that encompasses phases of exploration, ideation, iteration, designing, and building\nEvaluate and adapt the different phases of the innovation process\nContribute activly with your own disciplinary background in the different stages of the innovation process\nGive and receive constructive and appropriate feedback to and from team members and other teams\nReflect on how to act constructively in a context where the decision-making process is characterized by high uncertainty and risk of being led astray\nMake informed and qualified decisions in an innovation process with regards to the Feasibility, Viability, Desirability, Responsibility and Sustainability of a solution\nReflect on their role, ways of working, and value as an engineer in the innovation process\nCommunicate to the relevant stakeholders about the design of an appropriate Minimal Viable Product (MVP) in relation to both problem and value creation",
    "Content": "Innovation competencies are crucial for future engineers, particularly to thrive in organizations that face global competition and in tackling the societal challenges we face.\n\nThrough the course, students acquire relevant experiences and competences with a systematic approach to innovation in an engineering context. Students will develop unique insights into how integrated innovation is practised. They will experience multidisciplinary collaboration while working on a real innovation project from industry. Each project team will also be assigned a team facilitator (which are students who are taking the course 'Facilitating Innovation in Multidisciplinary Teams'). These facilitators have attained innovation competences and will guide the team during all project work.\n\nThe course is organized in two main parts.\nThe first week - the BOOST module - is focused on engaging the students with the topic of innovation, and introducing students to a systematic approach to innovation, including relevant theory. At the start of the first week, the students will be put into project groups on the basis of their chosen innovation challenge as well as their line of study et al.\nIn the second and third weeks - the EXPERIENCE module - the group's focus is on developing an innovation project in collaboration with their facilitator. This should result in a concept that must be presented to the stakeholders at the end of the process.\n\nThe course consists of lectures, reading material, group exercises, assignments, peer-reviews and multiple-choice quizzes. The learning activities are group-based and for that reason it is important to participate in class at DTU Campus",
