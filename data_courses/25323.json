    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of this course is to allow students to study a current topic, within Marine Science and Technology which is not covered by existing courses in the master education. This may be in the form of a literature review, an experimental study or a modelling exercise. Objectives are developed on an individual/group basis.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nPlan and execute an independent research project (or literature study).\nSynthesize knowledge within a specialized topic.\nMake a short oral presentation.\nEvaluate other presentations.\nA project-specific learning objective.\nA project-specific learning objective.\nA project-specific learning objective.\nA project-specific learning objective.",
    "Content": "The course provides a common framework for the development of individual student projects (or small group of students). Each student/group should engage in developing a project within a special topic of interest, which is not covered by any of the existing courses of the education. To this end each student/group should be associated with a supervisor among the teachers of the master education. The course will provide common introductory, mid-term and final sessions to: 1) help establish collaboration between students and 2) contacts with supervisors, and 3) to provide feedback on the work in the middle and at the end of the semester. The projects developed by the students should all be defined by a short “problem” statement, which characterizes the overall goal of the work being undertaken. The problem statement, four specific learning objectives, and content are described on a one-page project outline developed in collaboration with the supervisor during the first weeks.",
