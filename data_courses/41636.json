    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course introduces key theory, methodology and practice to support the conceptualisation, design, development and implementation of circular solutions. In addition, theoretical frameworks for the analysis of technical and biological cycles are introduced, including the means to evaluate circular materials and resource flows. A number of industry case studies will act as the case material for the course, which will be supported by academic articles, course material and worked exercises.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain how Circular Economy contributes to sustainable development at the micro, meso and macro levels\nDiscuss potential policy and regulatory instruments and their impacts to implement Circular Economy in practice\nAnalyse the key value chain stakeholders and determine which mechanisms are essential for value chain management in circular economy transition\nCritically analyse the readiness of companies in transitioning to Circular Economy and recommend transition paths\nApply modelling and assessment approaches in implementing the Circular Economy and appraise development needs\nConceptualise innovative business models capable of decoupling value creation from resource consumption\nDesign products and systems for circularity, according to a set of circular economy strategies\nDebate the role smart technologies can play in facilitating the Circular Economy\nDesign closed-loop systems and discuss a holistic and sustainable resource management within them\nManage the transition to circularity within an organisation, with respect to resources, capacity building, planning and internal motivation\nCollaborate to solve practical problems in a transition towards the Circular Economy, combining the knowledge acquired in the lecture part of the course",
    "Content": "The course is built upon the following modules: defining Circular Economy (CE); macro-economic viewpoints on CE; CE from a value chain perspective; CE motivation for companies; CE business model innovation; circular product design; sustainability modelling of CE; smart circularity; closing the loop and managing resources; transitioning to CE on a business and societal level.",
