    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give participants experience of integrated building design, and how specialised competences can be used in collaboration within multidisciplinary project teams to create a design fulfilling many functional requirements at the same time. In this course, you are working with the additional competences it takes to construct solutions to open ended problems compared with only being able to analyse a given construction. The course is based on solving in a complex and realistic design problem in groups which is in line with the demands given by the construction industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCollaborate with diverse members of the design team to realise interdisciplinary design solutions based on systems engineering principles that balance and integrate their own disciplinary technical requirements with those of the team to the satisfaction of the project requirements.\nDefine, monitor and evaluate their project team’s values (KPIs) in a professional manner.\nEvaluate the design models and reports from previous course cohorts to identify the challenges to balancing the project and disciplinary requirements in a complex building project.\nStrategise, track and update a design management scheme (DMS) to support team coordination and collaboration based on analysis of the project requirements.\nDevelop, maintain and evaluate a digital benchmark building model (BBM) to assess design proposals throughout the project against analysis of the project requirements\nCommunicate and investigate the building design and analysis using models, drawings, reports, diagrams, dashboards and presentations to internal and or external assessors to a professional level.\nGuide the building design team with technical subject reports based on disciplinary analysis to provide the scientific foundation for the 'higher level' guidance in the client report.\nActively support alternative interdisciplinary design solution options to support an integrated design process that provides meaningful choices to the client and design team.\nModel and analyse digital OpenBIM building models using computational design and disciplinary analysis tools to provide realtime guidance to the whole team throughout the design process.\nMake and justify your design decisions based on the project requirements, team needs and reflection on the client, disciplinary expert and peer feedback to improve the design throughout the design process.",
    "Content": "The course aims to teach you to balance your developing disciplinary expertise and responsibilities to the needs of the design team, client and project in a ‘real’ collaborative design process. The course follows an integrated building design process covering the following 4 stages:\n\nA) Analyse client and project needs in a 'real' project and develop strategies to address these in one of seven roles; Architect, Structures, MEP, Geotech, Fire, PM/ICT or Material/LCA.\nB) Design and analyse different options by defining evaluate different design tactics to satisfy your team’s design strategies in BIM to guide the client.\nC) Collaborate to integrate the building systems of different disciplines to satisfy technical and design requirements.\nD) Detail and communicate a final design to a variety of stakeholders in technical reports and a presentation including VR based on your reflection of the feedback received in the previous parts of the course.",
    "Course literature": "BIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Managers, Designers, Engineers and Contractors, Chuck Eastman, Paul Teicholz, Rafael Sacks, Kathleen Liston.",
    "Remarks": "There will be a group of teachers involved. The course is supported by input and feedback from leading industry experts an offer the opportunity for participants to apply advanced approaches to interdisciplinary building design using systems engineering.",
