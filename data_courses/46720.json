    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course is addressed to students who want a basic knowledge about high voltage engineering.\nThe teaching is directed towards an understanding of important electric phenomena, the understanding of which is necessary for correct design and construction of high voltage components and other apparatus with high electrical fields.\nLectures and experimental laboratory exercises are combined with several calculations and numerical simulations to give insight into the special test, measurement and calculation methods that are used within high voltage engineering, where high voltages and currents occur over a broad frequency range.\nThe students will be able to evaluate different types of insulation materials used in apparatus with high electrical field strengths and where aging phenomena due to electrical and thermal stresses are important.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nShow the most essential criteria for dimensioning of high voltage apparatus\nCalculate simple electric fields and important component parameters\nSolve electrical field problems numerically\nExplain electrical discharge phenomena and estimate their relevance for electrical insulation systems\nFormulate principles for component breakdown and relate them to laboratory tests\nEvaluate the electrical breakdown strength of different materials\nDesign systems for generation of ac, dc and impulse voltages\nChoose and apply suitable equipment for measurement of high voltages and currents",
    "Content": "After a general introduktion to high voltage engineering will methods for the calculation and control of electric fields in electric apparatus be covered, including numeric field calculations (FEM) for correct design of insulation systems.\nThe basic mechanisms in connection with the electric strength of gasses, liquids and solid dielectric media are studied. Lightning and lightning protection will be treated and illustrated by means of examples. Furthermore, the generation of high voltages under laboratory conditions is treated plus measurement of high voltages and currents also in the power system.\nThe topics are studied in further detail under the group work and laboratory exercises.",
