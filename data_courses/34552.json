    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course gives the student a solid foundation in the engineering concepts used in the design and construction of photovoltaic systems. The student will demonstrate knowledge of the working principles of the individual system components including, cells, modules, electronics and balance of system (BOS) components. The student will become knowledgeable in the entire value chain of photovoltaic (PV) systems from how solar cells and modules are fabricated to how photovoltaic systems are designed. The student will be able to explain the operation, performance, reliability, and economics from small scale residential systems to large scale PV power plants. Upon completion of this course the student will be able to design and model the energy and financial performance of a photovoltaic power system.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the physical principles of photovoltaic energy conversion in solar cells\nSketch fabrication of solar cells and modules\nEstimate the cell to module losses in the design of PV modules\nDescribe the working principles of the constituent components in a photovoltaic energy system;\nApply concepts in solar radiation and solar geometry to calculate irradiance on transposed surfaces\nEstimate the shading and solar resource at a given site\nModel and design grid-connected PV-systems using industry standard software\nApply financial models and metrics (LCOE, NPV) to evaluate the economic feasibility of a PV project\nOptimize the design of a PV system\nDescribe the factors that contribute to a photovoltaic system’s reliability and lifetime\nExplain O&M principles and prescribe appropriate fault detection methods for photovoltaic power plants\nIdentify the many applications and uses of photovoltaic power systems",
    "Content": "The course will explain the principle components within photovoltaic systems, how they work and how they interact within the system. The course will start by discussing the nature of the solar resource and then move into the fundamentals of solar cell physics where it will be explained how solar cells convert light to electricity and how they are manufactured. Subsequently, the course will cover topics in PV modules, including their design, fabrication, characterization and durability. Next, the course covers how to interface PV modules with power electronics where the working principles of PV electronics will be explained. Further into the course the most common power loss and degradation mechanisms found in fielded systems will be presented. These topics are finally combined and applied where the student will conduct group exercises covering PV system dimensioning, energy yield predictions, and economic calculations.",
