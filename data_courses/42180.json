    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course introduces a powerful method for market and demand analysis. The main objective is to make students capable of using discrete choice models to analyse choice behaviour, e.g. in transportation or energy systems. This includes how to conceptualise behaviour using a mathematical model, analyse behavioural data, and statistical modelling that can be used for forecasting and market analysis.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the basic principles behind discrete choice models\nClassify choice models and discuss their strengths and weaknesses\nAnalyse behavioural data using discrete choice models\nUse software to estimate discrete choice models\nInterpret and compare statistical analyses of choice data\nApply discrete choice models to do demand and market analysis\nCalculate valuation measures and elasticities of relevant attributes\nArgue concerning the usefulness of a specific model for a specific problem\nWrite a methodologically sound report containing description of the phenomenon using a descriptive analysis of the data, treatment of data, model estimation and a critical discussion of the results",
    "Content": "The course mixes lectures on methodology with exercises and applications of the models to data on behaviour in various contexts. The methodological part introduces the microeconomic framework based on random utility maximization that is fundamental for discrete choice models. Furthermore, it focuses on the most common discrete choice models: multinomial logit models and nested logit model. In addition, we also look at more advanced models and how they can enhance the realism of the modelling. The applications focus on how to apply the models to real as well as hypothetical data. The final part of the course focuses on overall and critical understanding of the methodology through application of the methods in a project.",
