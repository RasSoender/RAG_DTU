    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course introduces advanced theoretical topics in microfluidics, i.e., the dynamics of viscous fluid flow at the sub-millimeter scale under the influence of different physical forces. You will obtain a solid theoretical basis and a good starting point for subsequent project work on fluid physics, biological fluid dynamics, or lab-on-a-chip systems.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDerive the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation and the continuity equation from basic principles\nDerive the advection-diffusion (AD) equation from basic principles\nExplain the physics of important dimensionless numbers in microfluidics\nSet up and solve models of microfluidic flows using the NS equation\nSet up and solve advection-diffusion models of solute transport using the AD equation\nDescribe the basic physical principles of interactions between fluids and soft materials\nApply the NS equation to microfluidic flows in living cells\nExplain the physics of common particle transport mechanisms in microfluidics\nCommunicate methods, results, and conclusions in writing based on a specific physical system",
    "Content": "Microfluidics plays a crucial role in uncovering new flow phenomena, in developing theoretical models and experiments at the interface between physics, engineering, and biology, and in designing lab-on-a-chip systems that integrate entire laboratories on single microchips.\n\nThe course will help you develop your theoretical skills and physical understanding of fluid dynamics at the microscale. You will learn the basic theory of fluid dynamics, i.e., the transport equations for mass, momentum, and solutes. You will get acquainted with some of the dimensionless numbers that characterize fluid flows, and you will learn how to use them for setting up and analysing models in microfluidics. Progressively, you will learn methods to handle advanced microfluidic effects, including flows in complex channel geometries. Finally, you will learn how to apply microfluidics to technical and biological systems.",

    "Remarks": "Theoretical Microfluidics (10337) and Continuum Physics (10346) are independent. The courses only overlap in the introduction to the fundamental fluid dynamics equations.",
