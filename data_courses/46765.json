    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe significant advances in machine learning techniques have provided new opportunities for energy system applications, enabling to solve large-scale decision-making and risk assessment problems as well as efficient real-time operation and control of individual assets or a system of assets. The main focus of this course is to clarify the rationale behind the utilization of machine learning techniques in energy system applications. It equips students with tools and skills to effectively prepare data, recognize and employ appropriate machine learning methods for various energy system applications. Subsequently, students will apply these methods to a number of key examples from the viewpoint of both individual stakeholders and a system operator, while evaluating their performance.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain motivations for exploiting machine learning methods for energy system applications, identifying potential opportunities and challenges\nDiscuss key machine learning concepts and techniques for energy system applications\nApply mathematical tools and algorithms related to machine learning techniques for energy system applications\nInterpret how machine learning models can help solve complex problems in energy systems\nDevelop machine learning models from the perspective of both a system operator and an individual stakeholder\nApply the python programming language for processing data and implementing machine learning models\nAnalyze the results and evaluate the performance of machine learning methods adopted\nEffectively present and discus results from assignments in written form",
    "Content": "The course content is structured into three parts, each of which is finalized by means of an assignment.\n1. The course provides a big picture, i.e., an overview of relevant machine learning methods and relevant energy system applications from the perspective of both a system operator and individuals, taking into account the physics of assets. The applications cover problems to be solved in a forward stage (e.g., in a day-ahead stage) or in real time. We then map those energy system applications into relevant machine learning methods. We first take the perspective of a stakeholder. The examples to be covered are (i) renewable energy trading in electricity markets in a forward stage, (ii) wind resource prediction in a forward stage via classical and value-oriented learning methods.\n2. We still continue from the perspective of a stakeholder. The examples to be covered is real-time control of an asset, e.g., a battery storage or an aggregator of distributed energy resources in continuous electricity markets.\n3. We take the perspective of a system operator. The examples to be covered are optimal day-ahead scheduling and risk assessment of the entire system.\nFor all three parts, we will provide relevant methods, implement them for a case study and analyze results.",
