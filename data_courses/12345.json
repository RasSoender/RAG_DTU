    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall objective of this course is to enable you to understand and model water resources systems in an independent manner. You will learn to\n• Obtain hydrological time series data and spatial river basin data from public sources and analyze them using scripts and GIS,\n• Implement and validate your own hydrological models to describe rainfall-runoff and water balance relationships in river basins, and\n• Analyse and solve water resources management problems with optimization models and evaluate investments and policy scenarios with respect to environmental sustainability, economic efficiency and social equity.\nThe course is aimed at students that are interested in advanced hydrological and optimization modelling concepts. The course will be centered around real-world cases. It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of programming in scripting languages, GIS, and hydrological processes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nManage and analyze large hydrological data sets by means of scripting and GIS tools\nConstruct, implement and improve rainfall runoff and water balance models for river basins using scripting languages\nImplement numerical parameter estimation procedures on self-written models\nUnderstand and validate the assumptions behind mathematical modelling procedures\nDevelop optimization models of water resources systems\nIndependently access and use various global water resources databases\nDetermine efficient water allocation among the water users in the basin\nDetermine and interpret the net present value of a water project\nAnalyze the problems of internationally shared river basins and aquifer systems\nCommunicate modelling results and limitations in different formats",
