    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will give the students qualifications to analyze ceramic tile as a building material as well as the constructive and building physical conditions for masonry. On the course, experience is gained with production technology for bricks and mortars, masonry technology, as well as an analytical knowledge of the technical properties of these materials individually and when they are combined in masonry. The course will enable the students to assess the properties of masonry constructions both in terms of sustainability (environment) and durability.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the production techniques of bricks and mortars\nUnderstand the material composition and properties of masonry\nObtain experience with bricklaying\nKnowledge of the structural properties of masonry\nAbility to analyze a brickwork based on building physics principles and the properties of the brickwork\nAsses a masonry structure for sustainability\nCarry out a durability assessment of bricks and masonry\nAnalyze possibilities for renovation and reuse of masonry constructions\nAssess options for surface treatment of masonry constructions\nAssess the aesthetic and functional properties of masonry",
    "Content": "Review and analysis of material composition and properties of fired and unfired clay as well as common types of mortar. Teaching the principles of the structural properties of masonry. Teaching the methods to assessing the building physical conditions and properties of masonry in relation to the transport and storage of moisture and heat.\nVisit to a brick factory to be introduced to production techniques. Gaining own experience in bricklaying and carrying out laboratory exercises on the technical properties of bricks and masonry with associated analysis and assessment.\nTraining in analyzing the sustainability/environmental properties of masonry. Introduction to options for recycling bricks and masonry and training in assessing these methods. Introduction to the practical and aesthetic aspects of masonry with a view to being able to assess these.",
    "Remarks": "The course is offered so that parts of it will be co-taught with external course participants in a continuing education course. Thus, people from the industry will be met both as fellow course participants and as teachers.",
