    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will provide the student with competences in the organization and regulation of prokaryotic cell structure and metabolism. These competences will enable the student to describe and explain the function of regulatory and organizational networks, and to predict the results of genetic changes affecting the networks. Moreover, the student will be able to suggest novel designs within synthetic biology.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the mechanisms underlying the storage and controlled flow of genetic information in the prokaryotic cell.\nDescribe the key regulatory points in transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post translational control and provide examples of their exploitation by bacterial regulatory systems.\nDescribe the mechanism behind selected bacterial regulatory networks controlling: metabolic processes, stress response, chemotactic behaviour, cell division, differentiation, intercellular communication and pathogenicity.\nDescribe the general effects of regulatory mutations and changes in growth conditions on the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of a bacterial cell.\nSuggest simple mathematical models and perform calculations based on data derived from biological systems.\nRead and extract the important information from original research articles.\nAnalyze and interpret experimental results within prokaryotic cell biology and relate conclusions to known bacterial networks.\nPropose an experimental design for analysis of a scientific topic within cell biology.",
    "Content": "Cell biology is the integration of molecular biology with biochemistry and physiology explaining how the living cell grows, divides and evolves. In agreement with this view, cell biology focuses on design, organization and regulation at the whole cell-level. Because the field is integrative, we will rely heavily on biochemical knowledge of enzymes and pathways, as well as on knowledge from molecular genetics, molecular biology and systems descriptions of regulatory networks. Cell biology provides much of the scientific basis behind systems biology.\n\nTwo recurrent motifs will be highlighted throughout the course:\n• Understanding the interconnectedness of physiological, organizational and regulatory processes within the cell and\n• Devising strategies to intervene in these complex processes to manipulate an organism for scientific, biotechnological or medical purposes.",
