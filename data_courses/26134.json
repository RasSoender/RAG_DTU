    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give in-depth knowledge of the descriptive inorganic chemistry of the d- and f-block elements and their most important coordination compounds, organometallic chemistry, and transition metal chemistry in relation to e.g. homogeneous catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and metal-organic frameworks. Furthermore, the participants are introduced to the standard physical and spectroscopic characterization techniques for inorganic and organometallic compounds. Critical reading and analysis of contemporary scientific literature is an integral part of the course.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAccount for the periodic trends in chemical and physical properties of the d-block elements and their compounds.\nDescribe in detail the electronic structure and its relation to the chemical structure and reactivity in classical, low-valent, and high-valent d-metal complexes.\nDescribe the chemical and physical properties of the lanthanides and actinides.\nDiscuss the concepts of ligand activation, redox-active ligands, and small molecule activation.\nAccount for the relevance of transition metal ion properties in homogeneous catalysis.\nAccount for the principles and applicability of the most common thermodynamic and spectroscopic characterization techniques in inorganic chemistry.\nCritically assess scientific articles within the field of inorganic chemistry and transition metal-based homogeneous catalysis.\nPresent and discuss scientific results orally",
    "Content": "The chemistry of the d- and f-elements is treated comprehensively with particular focus on periodic trends, reactivity, and characterization. This includes organometallic chemistry that lays the foundation for the homogeneous catalysis seen from the transition metal ion perspective. The course is largely based on discussion of scientific articles with a focus on critical assessment of published results.",
