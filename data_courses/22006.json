    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course covers a broad variety of topics related to fundamental elements involved in acoustic communication: hearing (anatomy, physiology), hearing loss, perception of sound (psychoacoustics), speech production and intelligibility. Through lectures, participants will learn about these topics as well as psychoacoustic measurement methods. Working in groups, the students apply these methods in laboratory exercises and present their results in written reports.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe the structure of the ear and explain the function of the various components.\nsketch the hearing threshold in a free field (dB SPL-Frequency) and interpret the course of the curve.\ncompare classical and adaptive psychometric methods, explain psychoacoustical measurement methods, and explain a psychometric function.\nexplain the concept of loudness and loudness level and describe Stevens’ power law.\nexplain the concept of masking (simultaneous-, forward-, backward-) and it’s relation to the function of the inner ear.\nexplain how speech is produced and describe the physical properties of the speech signal.\ndefine the concept of speech intelligibility, explain how different factors influence intelligibility, and discuss methods for measuring speech intelligibility.\ndescribe the principles of sound localization and sketch results of localization measurements.\nwrite an exercise report that is comprehensible to other students.",
    "Content": "The anatomy and physiology of the ear. Psychophysical principles and psychoacoustic measuring methods. The relation between physical sound impact and subjective sound perception. Psychoacoustics (hearing threshold, loudness, masking, frequency selectivity etc). Localization of sound signals. Description of the speech signal. Measurement of speech intelligibility.",
    "Remarks": "Students that plan to take the course 22003 \"Auditory Signal Processing and Perception\" should take this course (Acoustic Communication) first, not after. The course works ideally in combination with course 22007.",
