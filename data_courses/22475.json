    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of the course is to give a thorough introduction to the phenomenology and fundamental principles of tissue biomechanics. Focus will be on the human hip joint, large tendons, and blood vessel walls of arteries/veins. Both the anatomy and physiology as well as modeling of the mechanical behavior of these structures will be taught.\nAs a student, you will make reports describing lab exercises performed as part of the course. The reports must be handed in during the course, and are qualifying for the final course assessment which is an oral exam. Further, the course has part exams in terms of mandatory homework assignments with grading.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nlist the fundamental mechanical conservation laws.\nue basic vector and tensor calculus to solve a biomechanical problem.\nuse arguments of symmetry to determine relevant material parameters/properties.\nexplain the physical significance of constitutive equations.\nformulate biomechanical models for various types of tissues.\ndescribe the anatomy and physiology of the human hip joint, large tendons, and arteries/veins.\nproduce experimental data that can serve as boundary conditions for a biomechanical model.\nsolve a biomechanical problem using the finite element method.\nsummarise and evaluate the implications of model results.\nwrite reports fulfilling the basic requirements for scientific communication.\npresent a scientific paper on a limited biomechanical topic to fellow students.",
    "Content": "In this course we will go through the anatomy and physiology of the human hip joint, large tendons and the blood vessel wall of arteries/veins. Also, the necessary mathematics of vector and tensor analysis used in biomechanical problems will be adressed. The mathematical formalism is subsequently used to formulate the fundamental conservation laws and different types of constitutive equations which in conjunction form the basis of all biomechanical modeling. Examples include elastic, visco-elastic, and hyper elastic tissue materials.\nWe will read and discuss scientific papers describing various biomechanical problems to provide you with insight into how research is performed within these areas.\nThe course also incorporates experimental work, where you will collect data to analyse a given biomechanical problem set-up. Demonstrations of biomechanical data collection will take place at the Panum Institute.\nDuring the course you will be given time to perform finite element analysis of the biomechanical problems where you have collected the necessary experimental data. You must hand in written reports describing your findings and the implications of the model results. These reports have to be approved, and approval qualifies you for the final oral exam",
