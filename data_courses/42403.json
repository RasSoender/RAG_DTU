    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn the era of digitalization, the importance of operations management is tremendous for sustainable economic growth. The effectiveness and efficiency of various production and service systems can be improved by analytics. Optimization methodologies and simulation techniques offer many opportunities for better decision-making and planning in volatile environments. This course aims to teach advanced operations management problem-solving technologies like modeling, optimization, and simulation with application to production and service operations management. Students should be able to make sound decisions and lead critical discussions in the context of operations management. The course promotes abstract thinking and develops abstract problem-solving competencies.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the fields of production and service operations and can differentiate between them\nExplain examples of advanced planning problems and models in production and service operations\nAssess the applicability of different analytical tools in advanced operations management\nAnalyze case studies in advanced operations management\nModel advanced production and service operations problems and solve these models with appropriate mathematical methods\nAnalyze production and service operations problems and make sound decisions in the field of advanced operations management\nDiscuss and reflect upon important managerial insights in the context of advanced operations management\nApply and transfer the knowledge to any operations management problem",
    "Content": "The course will introduce the students to advanced operations management in the age of digitalization. Modern planning problems from production and service operations management will be analyzed, modeled, and solved using mathematical programming and simulation. The focus is on increasing effectiveness and efficiency in current business operations. The students will work on case studies, applying the theoretical knowledge to real-world decision-making problems. Critical thinking and abstract problem-solving capabilities are taught throughout the course.",
