    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with basic knowledge about the biorefinery concept and integrated processes that convert biomass into multiple products of bioenergy, biomaterials and biochemicals. An important part of the course deals with the importance and the use of Green Chemistry and Sustainability principles, and all the examples and the report are elaborated always on the basis of such principles",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the physical and chemical structures of biomass and their potential use for production of bioenergy, biomaterials and biochemicals\nIdentify and describe biomass resources (forest, agricultural, municipal and marine biomass), their occurrence and application in a biorefinery concept\nIdentify and describe biomass constituents (starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, protein, lipids)\nOutline the principles of a biorefinery including chemical, biological and thermo-chemical conversion methods\nOutline and compare various methods of biomass processing for production of bioenergy products, biomaterials, chemicals and building blocks for chemical synthesis\nDescribe the differences between aerobic and anaerobic biological processes\nDescribe the steps of anaerobic digestion processes\nDetermine reactor configuration to treat specific biomass types\nWrite a scientific report\nDesign a theoretical and creative biorefinery based on scientific references\nUse literature databases concerning renewable resources and sustainable management",
    "Content": "The course will give a broad perspective over the biorefinery concept by introducing the key integrated processes, such as biomass production, pretreatment, and chemical-, biological- and thermo-chemical- conversion. The lectures will focus on bioresources and single processing steps and will include industrial and scientific examples. In the case study the students will combine multiple processing steps into a novel biorefinery concept. There will be emphasis on sustainable systems throughout the course.\nThe course is divided into four main blocks:\n1. Chemical characterization of biomass and recovery of biochemicals of industrial interest. Calculations include mass balances and stoichiometry.\n2. Green processes/techniques used in biorefineries: Fermentation processes, Enzyme technology, Membrane technology, Clean solvents, Integration reaction-separation, Use of various pretreatment processes eg. thermochemical, microwaves/ultrasound.\n3. Introduction to Energy from Biomass: Physical, microbiological, and thermodynamic processes. Gasification and pyrolysis. Biogas.\n4. Other applications: Biomaterials.\n5. Biological treatment methods for waste and wastewater for production of bioproducts, biofuels and energy",
    "Remarks": "The study material will be based on a compendium and international journal articles.",
