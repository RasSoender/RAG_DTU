    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to give an overview of the 1D and 2D NMR techniques that are being used in an NMR based structural and conformational analysis.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDemonstrate knowledge of which type of structural information may be gained from different 1D, 2D homo- and heteronuclear NMR experiments.\nDemonstrate knowledge with respect to the fundamental theory behind some of the previous mentioned NMR techniques\nUse the previous mentioned NMR experiments for structural analysis of organic compounds.\nAnalyze conformational and structural problems within organic and biological compund classes.\nDemonstrate knowledge as to how different stereoisomers may give different spectra and how such spectra are evaluated.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the terms T1 and T2 relaxation and understand how these values may be obtained from different NMR spectra and how they may effect the design of the 2D experiments.\nBe able to extract spatial information from 1D- and 2D NOE spectra.\nDemonstrate knowledge about the principles behind Rotating frame and its applications within NMR spectroscopy.\nPredict how a spectrum might look based on a given organic compound.\nDemonstrate theoretical and practical experience with data processing of the individual NMR experiments.",
    "Content": "The course will cover an introduction to the different 1D and 2D homo- and heteronuclear NMR techniques with emphasis on what type of structural and functional information the different NMR experiments yield. This will include a description of the different NMR experiments. The analysis of different conformational and structural problems related to organic and biologically interesting compound classes will be covered.",
