    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nNumerical simulation is used for solving problems which are so complex that a theoretical model of the system cannot be solved by analytical methods. The goal is to enable the student to formulate a model of a real-life problem, implement and validate this model on a computer, and perform experiments with the computer model. Emphasis is put upon models involving stochastic elements, which are simulated by so-called Monte Carlo methods.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nApply build-in random number generators in various software products\nImplent algorithms for random number generation from various distributions\nPerform simple statistical analysis of simulated data\nApply simulation based statistical techniques like bootstrap and Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nApply simulated annealing as a heuristic method for minor optimization problems with discrete variables\nDevelop and implement simulation procedures for simple technical systems using the event by event principle\nPerform verification of a programme for simulation\nPerform validation of a simulation model\nPlan and execute a simulation study for a specific part or function of some (technical) system\nApply techniques for variance reduction in a simulation study\nPresent the results of a simulation study writtenly or verbally",
    "Content": "The first six to seven days deals with theory and exercises, followed by a case-study during the remaining part of the last two weeks. Attendance is mandatory for the first period of the course.\nTheory: The modelling process, methods of solution, random number generation, sampling from statistical distributions. Discrete simulation: Time-true simulation, event-by-event principle, variance reduction. Case-studies: Operations research real-life problems, e.g. performance of data- and telecommunication systems, production planning, inventory control, optimal stochastic control etc.",
