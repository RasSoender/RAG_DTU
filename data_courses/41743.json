    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe students will work hands-on with the complete product development of a specific device: from clarification of requirements and technology possibilities to manufacturing and testing of prototypes. The final aim is the production of some working prototypes along with a full product description including tolerancing, material selection and production related information.\n\nAfter the project the students will be able to:\na) Describe and apply methodologies for developing specific micro mechanical components to a prototype level\nb) Evaluate and choose micro manufacturing processes for specific components\nc) Propose technical solutions to manufacturing problems\nd) Present in a professional way their final proposition and prototypes\ne) Understand the complete product development process, emphasizing on collaboration, project management and integration",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify and derive detailed technical specifications of a micro mechanical component based on functional requirements\nPropose various technical solutions and criteria to select the best one\nApply the design for manufacturing (DFM) approach for various design proposals and select the right materials\nConduct design FMEA (Failure Mode Effect Analysis)\nRank and choose different designs based on criteria such as functionality, manufacturability and sustainability\nEvaluate selected micro manufacturing processes using experimental approaches\nProduce CAD drawings (both 2D and 3D) for the developed micro mechanical systems and related production equipment\nProduce and evaluate functional prototypes by digital manufacturing techniques (e.g. 3D printing)\nPresent decisions and results in terms of reports and presentations",
    "Content": "In the course students will work on design and production of a specific micro mechanical device. The device will be based on polymers and/or metal materials. The corresponding manufacturing technologies include micro injection moulding, hot embossing of micro structures, CNC milling, micro electrical discharge machining, electroforming, additive manufacturing, joining, and assembly at micro scale. The starting point is a set of functional requirements for the device. The students have to transform these requirements into technical specifications, technical drawings and working prototypes. The realization of the prototypes involves hand-on work with selected micro manufacturing processes suitable for Industry 4.0.",
    "Remarks": "The course content will partly be linked to the activities at CAMM – Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Micro Systems (www.camm.elektro.dtu.dk)",
