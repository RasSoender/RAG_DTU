    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nOptimisation is one of the most important components of data science. Integer Programming lets you estabish optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex decision support problems within production, energy, transport etc. This courses gives the students a thorough introduction to formulating and solving integer programming problems. Participants will be able to formulate integer programming problems as well as applying it to a wide range of optimisationsproblem in order to utilise your data to its full capacity.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine what a mixed integer program, an integer program and a binary program is compared to a linear program.\nConstruct an integer programming model with objective function, constraints and variable definitions based on a simple textual description of the problem.\nDefine a formulation and show examples of how it is used in integer programming.\nApply bounds on an integer programming problem and evaluate its efficiency.\nDefine a relaxation and mention examples of relaxations from the course. Also define an LP relaxation and a Lagrangian relaxation.\nApply Lagrangian relaxation on a simpel IP problem.\nConstruct a branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm for a standard IP problem.\nExplain the meaning and contents of the central theorems within integer programming as selected in the course.\nDemonstrate the use of valid inequalities and cuts in general and specifically with a given simple IP problem. Define Gomory cuts.\nDescribe the challenges when making the extension from valid inequality and cuts to a branch-and-cut algorithm (B&C).\nDescribe on a high level the applications of B&B, B&C, upper and lower bounds when implementing an efficient solution method for simple IP problems (especially for TSP).\nConstruct a dynamic programming algorithm for a simple problem based on \"principle of optimality\", \"stage\" and \"state\" .",
