    "Green challenge participation": "This course gives the student an opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU's Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More information http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo introduce students to the use of numerical methods in hydraulics. In this course the solution to various coastal and offshore engineering problems will be obtained by using a commercial numerical modelling software (MIKE 21 of DHI). The course will focus on typical applications encountered in marine and coastal environments.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nEstablish a nearshore hydraulic modelling complex based on the MIKE 21 software package.\nEstablish MIKE 21 model input including bathymetry, wind, wave and sediment maps and tidal forcing.\nSolve the depth-integrated flow equations, spectral wave equations and the combined wave-current sediment transport using the MIKE 21 numerical modelling complex.\nApply numerical methods including meshing of domains and account for its impacts on the solution.\nProvide practical assessments and interpretations of the MIKE 21 numerical solutions.\nInterpret complex surf zone and offshore processes.\nSolve a major and realistic exercise problem using the established MIKE 21 modelling complex.\nPresent results of numerical calculations in a transparent, easily accessible and applicable form.\nWrite up a well-structured hydraulic report on the assignment upon the completion of course.",
    "Content": "In this course the fundamental hydrodynamics and wave dynamics obtained as part of course 41111 will be applied. The students will recieve an introduction to the most relevant modules in the DHI MIKE software package such as the hydrodynamic (HD), spectral wave (SW), sand transport (ST) and mud transport (MT). During the last half of the course the students will work in groups to establish their own complex models to solve a realistic engineering problem. Such problems could be: i) Flow and wave simulations to provide design conditions for a potential offshore wind mill farm, ii) Dispersion of contaminants in a coastal environment and, iii) Sediment transport and coastline evolution around a harbour.",
