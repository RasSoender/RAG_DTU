    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe main purpose of this course is to introduce students to the methods and tools that are used when transferring a cell from a lab or research environment to pilot and full scale. The student following this course should therefore acquire a better understanding of the interactions between the cells and the hardware (the reactor), and will learn how to aim for optimal conditions for the cells to grow in large scale.\nThe lectures will be given by experienced DTU teachers, combined with guest teachers from industry. The course includes visits to the pilot plant of DTU Chemical Engineering and to industry (e.g. pilot plant environment).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nSet up a mass balance for different bioreactor operating modes\nSimulate different reactor operating modes and interpret the simulation results\nDescribe the effect of introducing basic process control on a process in a bioreactor\nDescribe the essential challenges related to solid state fermentations and fermentation processes using gaseous substrates\nSelect a suitable set of on-line measurements for a cultivation process, as well as distinguish between pros and cons of specific basic and advanced sensor devices\nDescribe the effect of scale on the performance of a microorganism, as well as pros and cons of different methods to mathematically describe or simulate effects of scale\nDevelop process based strategies to optimize product formation in a fermentation process\nDistinguish between different downstream unit operations and evaluate the pros and cons of introducing in situ product removal (ISPR) on a specific process\nDesign possible ways to transfer an engineered cell factory to pilot and/or full-scale.\nDesign and implement a basic strategy for collection and handling of data on a fermentation process\nDistinguish between basic AI tools for fermentation data processing",
    "Content": "• reactor designs (the hardware)\n• reactor operating modes\n• mass balances related to the different operating modes\n• suspended growth systems vs. immobilized growth systems (biofilms)\n• miniaturized reactor systems for high throughput fermentation\n• scale-up and scale-down of a process\n• on-line sensors (both traditional and novel systems) and biosensors\n• basic bioreactor control concepts\n• on-line process control\n• introduction to computational fluid dynamics and compartment models\n• data (types of data, on-line versus off-line), proper handling of data\n• different ways to use the available data (estimate parameters in a mechanistic model, extract process knowledge)\n• basic concepts of artificial intelligence applied to fermentation data",
