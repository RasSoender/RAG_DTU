    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with theoretical insight and understanding for GMP, hygiene and quality management systems. This involves legal requirements, relevant Standards and guidelines, audits and auditing, documentation and work methologies used in companies within the pharmaceutical, biotechnological and food industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify the necessary quality requirements imposed to an organisation and its buildings, production equipment, personnel and procedures of a pharmaceutical, biotech or food company, which is subject to follow GMP regulations, food regulations or ISO quality standards.\nCompare GMP, food and hygiene rules and Standards from various national and international regulatory authorities and standardization organizations and be familiar with their document structure.\nApply GMP rules and the ISO 9001 Standard for the preparation, execution and reporting of a audit simulation for a virtual pharma company\nUtilize HACCP methology for risk assessment of pharma and food industry processes\nUnderstand the design and qualification processes for pharmaceutical industry\nInterpret a Pipe & Instrumentation diagram for production process and units to identify the important details with relevance to GMP and hygiene.\nUnderstand the quality demands and standards for utility systems (e.g air, water and steam) to be in compliance with GMP and hygienic standards.\nUnderstand cleaning principles for GMP compatable production plants.",
    "Content": "The course covers basic GMP requirements from international and Danishl authorities, as well as from the international standardization organizations endorsed by the authorities. The theory also covers the life cycle of medicine products, food safety sustainability, HACCP methods, ISO quality standards, quality management systems, document control, hygienic design and cleaning of process plants and GMP compliant utilities.\n\nThe teaching is a mixture of lectures, as well as group problem solving and group written reports\n\nThe practical reporting in the course is based on a simulated auditing exercise where the team will audit a virtual pharma company which is represented by the course teachers. The team must prepare an audit preparation report, conduct an audit and prepare a final audit report. The latter report applies to 30% of the course evaluation.\n\nIn the auditing exercise, there is a special focus on general GMP rules and particularly on the guideline ICH Q7 \"GMP for API\" and the ISO 9001: 2015 Standard. Based on information about the virtual pharma company's production processes and organizational structure, the team must make an audit plan and prepare audit questions. which is practiced during the actual audit session which takes place with the course teachers representing the pharma company.\n\nTo facilitate the understanding of GMP as a real team effort involving all professional disciplines in real life, the groups will usually be composed of students with different backgrounds and knowledge.\n\nPeer reviews are part of the learning and evaluation methods for certain group work.\n\nThere is usually a half-day visit to a pharmaceutical company. (If possible due to Covod-19)",
    "Course literature": "Course Compendium + presentation slides+ problem solving notes",
    "Remarks": "Guest lecturers from industry\nThe GMP course (formerly 28855) is divided into a practical version 28857 to 7.5 ECTS, and a theoretical version 28855 to 5 ECTS.\n28857 are held autumn semesters and 28855 spring semesters.",
