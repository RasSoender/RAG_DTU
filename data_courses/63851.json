    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose of the course is to enable the student to participate in projects and critically and appropriately apply project management tools, concepts, models and theories in practice.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAppraise the relevance of projects to engineering practices\nExplain and critically assess the nature of projects based on four key perspectives (purpose, people, complexity, and uncertainty )\nIdentify projects potential impact on sustainability (SDGs)\nIdentify and describe typical mistakes and good practices in the management of projects\nApply appropriate tools, concepts, models and theories to analyze cases and real-life projects\nApply appropriate tools, concepts, models and theories to make practical recommendations\nApply appropriate tools, concepts, models and theories to explain project success and failure\nCompare project management theory and practice and discuss its strengths and weakness in general and in relation to cases and real-life projects\nCommunicate clearly, concisely and based on evidence",
    "Content": "Projects are integral to engineering work. Indeed, we argue that project management is the second most important skill of engineers. Therefore, project management competences are fundamental to all DTU students.\n\nThrough the course, the student develops unique insights into how project management is practiced through the analysis of a \"real\" world project. Furthermore, each student will experience the role of the project manager as each student will be responsible for planning and executing at least one day of the group work.\n\nThe course is organized around classical and online lectures, reading material, group exercises/games and assignments, peer-reviews and multiple-choice quizzes. As a large portion of the learning activities occurs in groups, class participation is fundamental!\n\nThrough the group work, the students will analyze a real-life project. Here they are expected to apply tools, concepts, models and theories, both appropriately and critically, to understand the reasons for the project ‘success’ or ‘failure’, identify challenges and develop recommendations.\n\nIMPORTANT (TO DO BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE COURSE): Every student is expected to identify an exciting project and present it to the class on the first day of the course. The project should be completed, or close to completion, so it is possible to analyze its ‘success’.\n\nThe lectures will be in English, and we strongly encourage the students to write the final report in English. By far, most bachelor courses are in Danish. However, courses at master level are mostly, if not exclusively, in English. To facilitate the transition, DTU encourages the use of English language in some bachelor courses. This course is one of them. If the student does not feel comfortable with English, they are allowed to write the report in Danish.",
    "Course literature": "Will be announced before course start",
    "Remarks": "After the course the students can obtain an optional ISO 21500 certificate upon successful completion of a test administered by Dansk Standard.",
