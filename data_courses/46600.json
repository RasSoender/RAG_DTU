    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe goal is to provide the students with an understanding of how a wind turbine generates aerodynamic noise, how it can be mitigated and how it is transported in the atmosphere. This goal is supported by learning the numerical and mathematical modelling concepts. Furthermore, the students will learn how sound can be measured and physically interpreted.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the relevance of wind turbine noise for society\ninterpret and model basic acoustic wave motion\ninterpret and model the effect of flow on the acoustic wave motion\noutline the mechanisms of flow turbulence and aerodynamic noise generation\napply the concepts above to identify and model aerodynamic noise sources of a wind turbine\napply techniques to reduce and control noise sources of a wind turbine\napply your knowledge of acoustic wave motion to atmospheric sound propagation\nsolve an aeroacoustic problem numerically\nmeasure characteristics of a sound wave\nprocess data from microphone array measurements\nconduct and process data of an aeroacoustic wind tunnel experiment",
    "Content": "Aero-acoustics concepts, Linear wave equation and acoustic analogy, Noise mechamisms of wind turbines, Noise prediction models, Low noise wind turbine design, aeroacoustic measurements, sound propagation, Parabolic wave equations, Computational aero-acoustics, Conduction of a pre-defined wind tunnel experiment in the Poul La Cour wind tunnel and analysis of the data",
