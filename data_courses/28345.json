    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe reactors used in the bio-industries are designed according to the same general principles as those elsewhere in the chemical industry. However, there are some specific characteristics of bioreactions which require specialist treatment, such as the variable stoichiometry of fermentations and complexities of scale-up. Using a quantitative approach, bioreactions are analyzed with respect to feasibility and scale-up for the production of a range of bio-based products (including cells, proteins and chemicals). A variety of feedstocks (including waste sugars and gasses) as well as production technologies (including two-stage fermentation, microbial biocatalysis and enzymatic biocatalysis) will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on bioprocess economics and industrial implementation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the role of fermentation, microbial biocatalysis and enzymatic biocatalysis in the context of bioprocesses for production of industrial products (including cells, proteins and chemicals).\nCalculate mass balances for fermentations, including gas-liquid mass transfer\nCalculate elemental and redox balances for fermentation processes\nEvaluate the feasibility of fermentation, microbial biocatalytic and enzymatic processes in an industrial context and devise a research/development plan\nAnalyze the consistency of experimental data using simple models\nEvaluate productivity requirements of large-scale fermentation and biocatalysis\nCalculate the heat of production of aerobic fermentation process\nDescribe the principles for design and scale-up of a fermenter\nDescribe the role of two-stage fermentation and in-situ product removal in the context of fermentations for production of industrial products\nEvaluate simple downstream concepts from fermentation processes\nEvaluate simple economic models of fermentation and biocatalytic processes.",
    "Content": "Role of fermentation and biocatalysis in the sustainable manufacture of industrial products (including cells, proteins and chemicals).
