    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the students a) to analyse and design integrated circuits based on FPGA technology for use in broadband communications (broadband electronics), especially optical communication and, SDH, OTN, Ethernet, IP and MPLS systems; b) to understand the design principles involved spanning from specification and simulation over synthesis, verification and optimisation; c) to complete a design project, involving specification, implementation and documentation",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand fundamental problems in Broadband Electronics development\nDevelop a block level specification (group work)\nImplement a specification in VHDL/Verilog\nWrite efficient VHDL/Verilog code for communication applications\nPerform functional simulation of implemented design\nPerform synthesis and verification\nUse optimisation tools\nWrite a technical report documenting the project\nCarry through a structured development process for an engineering project\nEvaluate and provide constructive criticism for others’ work",
    "Content": "Survey of high-speed electronic design principles in digital communication systems. VHDL coding styles, FPGA architectures, parallel design, pipelining, memory control, scheduling, error detection, clock and data synchronisation. Hardware architectures and performance of telecommunications and data communication switch systems. Examples from recent or ongoing research. The student projects include high-speed design by use of VHDL (Very high-speed integrated circuits Hardware Description Language) based FPGA design tools.",
