    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course teaches the participants how to use dynamic building performance simulation to design sustainable buildings. The focus is on main design parameters like building envelope, building orientation (placement) and climate zone as well as on heating, cooling and ventilation systems. The course does not focus on basic principles related to functionality of heating, cooling and ventilation, but rather on a holistic approach to estimation and assessment of their performance. The students learn how different component models in the simulation work and what empirical models are they based upon. They come to explore the consequences of different design choices on indoor environment, energy efficiency and overall performance of the building. The students learn to analyze and interpret simulation results to optimize the design. During such process, they need to account for predefined performance requirements regarding indoor environment and energy consumption.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe and explain factors influencing sustainable building design in the context of building simulation model set-up (climate conditions, building site and orientation, intended use, etc.).\nRecognize requirements and boundary conditions that define functionality of heating, cooling and ventilation systems.\nIdentify appropriate component models in the simulation tool (façade and window models, heating , cooling and ventilation components, controllers).\nCreate a simulation model of a given building. Calculate indoor environment and energy consumption for typical rooms by use of dynamic calculation models.\nExamine simulation results to judge the performance of the designed building. Critically compare different model variants and argue for the optimum solution.\nCharacterize the influence of different design parameters on overall performance of the building with respect to indoor environment and energy efficiency.\nEvaluate quality of obtained simulation results.\nPresent the results of simulation based design in graphical form on a poster.\nPresent the results in a short consise technical report.",
    "Content": "Building simulations tools are an integral part of design processes for modern buildings. They are used to estimate the performance of building envelope, heating cooling and ventilation systems, and other relevant components and services. Moreover, they are used to assess influence of human behavior and control systems. The present course focuses on applying dynamic building simulations and gives an overview of possibilities and limitations related to their use. In the course, a dynamic building simulation tool IDA Indoor Climate and Energy is used (IDA ICE). The enables simulation of thermal behavior of buildings as well as airflow modelling. Moreover, IDA ICE comprises a daylight simulation module. Using IDA ICE the course participants learn to set up a model for building envelope, including models for walls, windows, solar shading and natural ventilation. The components representing internal heat sources, occupant loads (emission of heat and moisture) as well as artificial lighting etc. are used to define human activities and associated thermal and moisture loads. The participants learn how to use models for heating elements (water radiators, fan-coils), cooling units (air conditioners) as well as air handing systems and energy sources (chillers, boilers, heat pumps, district heating substations). The course introduces use of different control components (thermostat, PI controller). Regarding analysis of results, the participants learn to use IDA ICE’s result visualization module comprising tabular results, graphical time series, heat map plots and 3D visualizations. Besides the actual model set-up and use, the participants are introduced to basic design principles for sustainable and high performance buildings dealing with the climate context, orientation, shape and materials for building envelope as well as choice of climate conditioning systems.",
    "Remarks": "In the teaching, it is required that students bring their own PC. To run the programs used in the teaching, students must ensure that they can run Windows-based programs.",
