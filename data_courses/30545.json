    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to give the student insight into and practical experience with methods to analyze and process spatial and temporal data. The methodologies are applied to data sets within the fields of mapping, navigation, and earth observations.\n\nThis course has a strong practical aspect. The students are presented with the methodologies providing the foundation for their own implementation (in R) and real data analysis.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nlist and describe commonly used covariance models\ndescribe the principle of maximum likelihood estimation\nexplain the concept in a state-space model\napply well known processes in modeling such as a random walk and an autoregressive model\nimplement different algorithms for spatial modeling such as kriging and Gaussian Markov random fields\ncompare and evaluate models\ndiscuss and defend choice of model\ndesign a spatial or temporal model to analyse real data\ndocument and present scientific work.",
    "Content": "Spatial and temporal data are an integrated part of earth science. The content of this course will introduce some general tools to handle such data.\nSome specific topics are:\n• Maximum likelihood estimation\n• Covariance functions\n• Gaussian Markov random field\n• State-space model\n• Kriging\n• Model evaluation",
