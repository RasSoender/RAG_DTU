    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIt is almost certain that at some point in a physics career you will have to perform measurements using electronic equipment. It is my goal to give you an introduction to the tools and techniques you will need to not just get great quality data, but understand, redesign, and troubleshoot such electrical measurement systems. Some of the most challenging measurements you can make will be of novel nanoelectronic devices, so we will focus on these – they can be exquisitely sensitive and very precious, especially if you are the one that has made them!\n\nThrough lectures, problem sets and laboratory practical work, you will gain an understanding of how to minimise noise, maximise signals and eliminate common sources of measurement error and device failure in these very sensitive systems. After completing the course, you will be able to critically analyse and discuss how electrical measurement systems for nanomaterials devices are put together and how techniques are applied, as well as design your own measurement set-ups, surpassing common ‘black-box’ approaches.\n\nIn this new course, we will be working closely together to shape the content to be most beneficial to you in your future career, be that in research or in industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAssess, select and use convenient, high-precision, DC and/or AC circuits to measure devices made from novel nanomaterials\nUnderstand the different sources of noise and measurement error and design better measurement systems on this basis\nMake informed selections of measurement devices and geometry, cabling and interconnects, shielding, grounding, electrostatic discharge prevention, and other system design parameters\nPerform data analysis to obtain intrinsic electrical properties of conducting nanomaterials (resistivity, mobility)\nTroubleshoot common measurement problems such as low signal to noise, source loading effects, parasitic resistances (leakage), capacitances and inductances, impedance mismatches, etc.\nDesign small practical circuits for filtering,signal buffering and amplification\nCarry out a short independent measurement project\nWrite laboratory records and document research results\nPrepare and present a talk on a journal article",
    "Content": "Each week is structured into subsections. In the beginning of the week we will discuss the required material for the week in class and you will complete practical electronic laboratory exercises and problem sets to cement your understanding.",
