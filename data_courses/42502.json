    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to equip the student with key competencies in facilitating innovation in multidisciplinary teams in an engineering context.\nStudents will:\n\n- Understand what it takes to facilitate an innovation process in a business case\n- See the big picture of the innovation landscape, by navigating their role in it, given their advanced innovation and facilitation competencies\n- Facilitate collaboration and develop innovative initiatives in a group context\n- Create new solution-oriented ideas and mature these into a final concept proposition\n- Acquire DTU's signature mindset to innovation and further develop their own approach to innovation\n- Be able to communicate to relevant stakeholders\n- Earn a toolbox of methods to structure innovation",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the importance of the relationship between Feasibility, Viability, Desirability, Responsibility and Sustainability of an innovation solution\nExplain central theories of team dynamics relevant to the innovation process\nExplain relevant approaches to the facilitation of teamwork in an innovation process\nExplain methods for leading and facilitating the different stages of an innovation process e.g., exploration, ideation, iteration, designing, and building\nApply methods to support and maintain a collaborative environment in the processes of exploration, ideation, iteration, designing, and building\nFacilitate evaluations and adaptations of the different phases of the innovation process\nGuide team reflections on group dynamics and teamwork with regard to the division of tasks and responsibilities and the inclusion of diverse disciplinary backgrounds in the different stages of the innovation process\nGive and receive constructive and appropriate feedback to and from team members and other teams\nApply methods to facilitate constructive teamwork in a context where the decision-making process is characterized by high uncertainty and risk of being led astray\nSupport the making of informed and qualified decisions in an innovation process with regards to Feasibility, Viability, Desirability, Sustainability, and Responsibility\nReflect on their role, ways of working, and value as an innovation facilitator in the innovation process.\nDocument and communicate to relevant stakeholders the innovative process for the design of an appropriate Minimal Viable Product (MVP) in relation to both problem and value creation",
    "Content": "Competencies to facilitate innovation in multidisciplinary teams are crucial for future engineers, more specifically to be able to thrive in organizations that face both global competition and societal challenges that need to be tackled.\nThrough the course, students acquire relevant experiences and competencies with a systematic approach to facilitating innovation in an engineering context.\nStudents will develop unique insights into how the facilitation of integrated innovation is practised.\nThey will experience interdisciplinary collaboration through the facilitation of a multidisciplinary team while working on a real innovation project from the industry.\nEach project team (consisting of students who are taking the course 'Innovation in Engineering') will be assigned a team facilitator.\nAs a facilitator, you will bring your experience-based innovation skills into play and guide the multidisciplinary group through the entire project work.\n\nThe course is organized into two main parts.\nThe first week - the BOOST module - is focused on engaging the students with the topic of innovation, and introducing students to a systematic approach to facilitating innovation, as well as other relevant theories.\nAt the start of the first week, the students will be put into project groups based on their chosen innovation challenge as well as their line of study et al.\nThe second and third week - the EXPERIENCE module - are focused on facilitating the team through the innovation process. This should result in a concept that must be presented by the group to the stakeholders at the end of the process.\n\nThe course consists of lectures, reading material, group exercises, assignments, peer-reviews and multiple-choice quizzes. The learning activities are group-based and for that reason it is important to participate in class at DTU Campus",
