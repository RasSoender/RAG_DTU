    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will enable the students to relate properties and performance of metals and alloys to their internal structure (from atomic to macro scale), resulting from synthesis and subsequent (post-)processing/heat treatment. The course emphasizes the relation between process–microstructure–properties–performance of metallic materials and deals with both ferrous (steels) and non-ferrous (e.g. light-weight) metals and alloys.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nrelate phase diagrams and basic diffusion phenomena to the microstructure of metals and alloys\nrecognize the importance of solid state phase transformations to tailor the microstructure and properties of metallic materials\nexplain the influence of processing and post-processing treatments (e.g. heat treatment) on the microstructure and related properties of metals and alloys\nevaluate mechanical properties and performance\nidentify strengthening mechanisms to improve the mechanical behavior of metals and alloys\nclassify degradation of materials properties through mechanical interaction with the environment\nselect standard metallographic methods and mechanical testing to investigate microstructure and properties of metals and alloys for failure analysis of an industrial product\nrelate microstructure and properties of metals and alloys to their performance under various application-relevant conditions.",
    "Content": "Crystal structures and crystal lattice imperfections. Basic diffusion theory. Technologically relevant binary phase diagrams and transformation diagrams. Materials processing including heat treatment of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Mechanical properties and strengthening mechanisms. Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth. Degradation and failure including fatigue and creep. Materials characterization.\nThe scientific, technological and engineering contents of the course will be taught by means of lectures combined with group work on exercises of praxis relevance.\nThe course provides insights into current research work as well as working routines in industry.",
    "Remarks": "The course is also suitable for BSc and BEng students.",
