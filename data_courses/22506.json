    "Schedule": "Spring F1B (Thurs 13-17)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "Lectures and exercises at scanner and in databar. Traditional problem solving sessions are also part of the course. The participants contribute to the teaching by doing presentations of selected subjects within the course scope.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "F1B",
    "Type of assessment": "Oral examination and exercises\nTwo written assignments and an oral exam are weighted equally (half) in a single overall grade. The two written assignments must be passed separately to pass the course. Mathematical descriptions are prioritized.",

    "Previous Course": "31547",
    "Academic prerequisites": "22485 , Knowledge of MRI corresponding to notes at http://eprints.drcmr.dk/37/ is required (until and including k-space) and the corresponding mathematical formalism covered in course 22485. A questionnaire covering course prerequisites is available on the course homepage for repetition ahead of the course, but also to give participants not having taken 22485 insight into what they need to study themselves in advance. Limited programming experience is needed, e.g. Matlab or Python.",

    "Registration Sign up": "At the Studyplanner",
    "Green challenge participation": "Please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in DTU´s Study Conference on sustainability, climate technology, and the environment (GRØN DYST). More infor http://www.groendyst.dtu.dk/english",
    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe participants acquire sufficient insight in general aspects of MR scanning to choose methods and perform data analysis independently. This includes knowledge of safety, central MR concepts, mathematical formalism, methodology and instrumentation relevant for a broad range of MR methods. Specific commonly used clinical methods are additionally taught (relaxation time weighting, MR angiography and diffusion weighting) together with artifacts of relevance for these. Finally, the participants obtain insight into more special techniques such as spectroscopy and functional MRI (fMRI) that are central in MR research and based on widely used analysis methods.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain central sequences and concepts of relevance for MR scanning as well as understand and relate to technical and radiological MR literature.\noperate MR scanners under consideration of safety aspects.\nrecognize weighting in typical MR images and explain physiological meaning of image contrast.\ncharacterize MR system components and explain the practical significance of those.\nchoose techniques and parameters for recording of MR images with varying relaxation time weghting and explain relaxation time's and contrast agent's fundamental and clinical significance.\nconduct relaxation time measurements with explanation of error sources.\nexplain artifacts and k-space representations for often used MRI sequences such as multi-slice/multi-echo sequences, and single-shot techniques.\nchoose appropriate saturation techniques for suppression of signal from tissue with specific relaxation times, chemical structure or position.\nchoose measurement techniques and analysis methods for determination of parameters characterizing the dynamics of water molecules, and explain the fundamental and clinical significance of flow and diffusion weighting.\nconduct metabolic characterization and analysis using MR techniques.\nexplain contrast mechanisms and methods used for functional imaging.",
    "Content": "Sequences and contrast parameters, clinical applications, image interpretation and artifacts, paramagnetic contrast agents, proton spectroscopy, flow and diffusion weighting, MR hardware, imaging, MRI safety, technological trends.\n\nE-learning is used in the form of an online prerequisite quiz, and simulation of magnetic resonance phenomena.",
    "Course literature": "Book specified on course homepage as well as notes and articles made available for the participants.",
    "Remarks": "The course is aimed at students with an interest to work clinically or in research with MR scanning, or with a need to relate magnetic resonance to other techniques. It is a recommended prerequisite for DTU's advanced MR course, 22507.",
