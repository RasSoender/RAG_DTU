    "course title": "22210 Immune System in Health and Disease",
    "Danish title": "Immunsystemet ved sundhed og sygdom",
    "Language of instruction": "English",
    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nProgramme specific course (MSc), see more\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Applied Chemistry\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Biomaterial Engineering for Medicine\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering",
    "Schedule": "Autumn E1B (Thurs 13-17)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The course will be divided in distinct lectures each covering a tissue-specific type of immunity (e.g. cutaneous, mucosal) or an immunological disease (e.g. allergy, viral infection, autoimmunity). The lectures will be delivered by specialized researchers on a topic-by-topic basis for about one hour. They will be followed by 2-hour group exercises and quizzes and a general discussion of 0.5-1hr in the end to facilitate understanding.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "E1B",
    "Type of assessment": "Written examination and experiments\nThe exam consists of two parts: (1) A poster that is prepared and presented orally (the topic must be relevant to immunology). This part counts for 40%. (2) A final written exam (MCQ and essay questions). This part counts for 60%. The final grade is based on an overall assessment of the two parts.",
    "Exam duration": "Written exam: 3 hours",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide the students with an understanding of immune regulatory mechanisms within tissues. To provide the students with an understanding of tissue-mediated immunity, especially at barrier surfaces including the gut, skin and lung. To provide the students with an understanding of immune-mediated diseases and immune pathologies that are driven either by inborn errors or infections. Moreover, question-based group exercises will facilitate deep learning of: 1) selected topics within the aforementioned subjects, 2) key immunological concepts (e.g. tolerance, immune evasion).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nevaluate how basic immunological concepts determine immunity within tissues.\ncompare and contrast different types tissue-mediated immunity.\ndefine and interpret mechanisms of tissue-specific immune responses.\nanalyse the outcome of diseases based on immunological processes.\nevaluate how specific cellular and molecular mechanisms determine the outcome of immune mediated and autoimmune diseases.\nevaluate how specific cellular and molecular mechanisms determine the outcome of viral and bacterial infections.\nevaluate how specific cellular and molecular mechanisms determine the outcome of cancer immunity.\nevaluate how specific cellular and molecular mechanisms determine the outcome of immunodeficiency.",
    "Content": "Putative topics include:\n\n1. One “tube” to rule them all – the immune system of the gut\n\n2. Careful what you put in our mouth – gastrointestinal infections and food allergies\n\n3. Getting under your skin – the cutaneous immune system\n\n4. Resident evil – causes and mechanisms of autoimmunity\n\n5. It’s not just about breathing – the immune system of the respiratory tract\n\n6. When breathing becomes hard – the immunology of asthma\n\n7. Lacking the essentials – immunodeficiency and how it can teach us basic immunology\n\n8. Hide and seek – natural immunity to cancer and how it can be evaded\n\n9. The Immuno-Holly Grail – mechanisms and applications of immunotherapies",
