    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will equip students with basic knowledge about selected psychological concepts, theories, and methods of key importance for understanding human behaviour from an engineering perspective. In addition, the course will teach the students how to utilize this knowledge for the design of products, interfaces and behavioural interventions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe the core abilities and limitations of human information processing and perception\nApply knowledge about human information processing to identify and analyze problematic human-machine interfaces\nDiscuss how human factors contribute to errors and accidents\nIdentify key cognitive, social and environmental factors that influence human behaviour\nReflect upon the effect of attitudes and norms on behaviour based on different theories\nDescribe selected psychological decision theories and theories of behaviour change\nApply a psychological theory to a guide a behaviour change intervention\nIdentify and describe applied psychological methods for the empirical study of human behaviour",
    "Content": "The course is divided into two blocks:\nThe first block is based on cognitive psychology and human factors research. Here, students learn about core abilities and limitations of human information processing and perception and will apply this knowledge to identify how easy or difficult a product or interface is to use in a usability test.\nThe second block is based on selected theories and concepts of social and environmental psychology. Here, students learn about attitudes and norms and their effect on behaviour and more general theories of behaviour and behaviour change. Based on this knowledge, they will sketch a behaviour change intervention and learn how to evaluate its effect based on a theory-based survey.",
