    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course presents an introduction to observations and physical theories of Earth and planetary magnetism. The focus is on describing the large-scale field structure and its time changes. This course provides the tools needed to construct global models of magnetic fields and the physical background needed to interpret magnetic observations made by satellites and on ground. This knowledge forms the basis for diverse applications in navigation and allows the study of planetary interiors.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexplain the various sources to Earth's magnetic field\ndescribe measurement techniques for the magnetic field\nwrite down and interprete equations describing geomagnetic field globally\nuse satellite magnetic field measurements to build global field models\nexplain the physics of internal sources of the geomagnetic field (core dynamo, lithospheric magnetization)\ndescribe how once can separate of the various sources\nuse measurements of the magnetic field to study Earth and Planetary interiors\nexplain the differences between planetary magnetic fields.",
    "Content": "Earth's magnetic field is generated by a range of different physical processes in the Earth's interior and surroundings: Dynamo processes in the core, induced electrical currents in the mantle, the magnetization of the crust, ocean currents and prevailing winds in the Earth's upper atmosphere, high-energy charged particles in the Earth's radiation belts, and electric currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere generated in the dynamic interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The course will detail the various contributions, how they are observed, separated, described (modelled), interpreted, and used to study the Earth system. Comparison will also be made with the magnetic fields of other planets and what they reveal about planetary interiors.",
