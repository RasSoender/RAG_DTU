    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nMany computer vision tasks were traditionally solved based on hand-crafted features, but are now solved using deep learning. Examples of such tasks include object detection, segmentation and classification. In this course the student will learn about some of these tasks and how to solve them with deep learning. This will enable the student to identify and describe a problem within computer vision, solve it using a suitable neural network architecture and analyze the performance of the solution.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDefine what is deep learning and explain the difference between deep learning models and traditional machine learning based on hand-crafted features in computer vision.\nSelect and implement suitable convolutional neural network architectures for classification, localization and segmentation.\nInterpret and illustrate the internal representations of a convolutional neural network\nDemonstrate knowledge of and use of popular techniques used for training neural networks.\nFind appropriate training data for a given problem as well as apply relevant data augmentation.\nSetting up convolutional neural networks to be trained with a custom dataloader on a remote server\nAssess and analyze the performance of convolutional neural networks.\nDefine and implement adversarial attacks to highlight instabilities in neural networks\nDefine, implement and discuss attribution methods from explainable AI",
    "Content": "The course contains lectures and exercises about neural networks for computer vision. The exercises takes the student from a concrete problem within computer vision to a solution based on neural networks. Topics covered include image recognition and understanding tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation.",
