    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students knowledge of the principles and main applications of modern electrochemistry in a way that is accessible to all with a foundation in physical sciences, not solely to chemists.\nThrough a series of lectures, group work, simulation and laboratory exercises, the students will learn about the basic principles of electrochemical reactions; some of the most commonly used transient and steady-state electrochemical methods, electrode polarization, and core electrochemical topics such as corrosion, electrodeposition, electrosynthesis/electrolysis, and electrochemical power sources will be covered.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nGive an overview of modern electrochemical terms and concepts\nDescribe the fundamentals of an electrochemical cell\nAnalyze and quantify cell and electrode polarizations in an electrochemical cell\nDetermine current efficiency of electrosynthesis/electrolysis processes\nDescribe the kinetics of electrochemical reactions\nCritically select appropriate electrochemical characterization techniques for investigation of specific properties of electrochemical cells\nPlan and perform electrochemical experiments (transient dc techniques, techniques relying on the use of periodic signals)\nAnalyze collected data from electrochemical experiments\nCritically assess sources of error and uncertainties in experimental work and results\nUnderstand the principles of working safely in the laboratory",
    "Content": "Introduction to electricity, charge carriers, conductivity, electrical circuits. Basic chemical concepts: activities, driving force, kinetics and ionic solutions. Principles of electrochemical cells, electrosynthesis, interfaces in electrochemical cells, electrical double layers, factors controlling electrode potentials. electrode reactions, Faraday’s law, kinetics, single and multi-step processes, transport processes, electrode and cell polarization, corrosion, electrodeposition, electrosynthesis/electrolysis, and electrochemical power sources. Two- and three-electrode cells. Steady state and transient voltammetry. Electrochemistry with periodic signals (e.g. electrochemical impedance, pulse voltammetry).",
    "Course literature": "In the course we only use teaching material - textbooks, assignments, articles, etc.- that is available free of charge via e.g. DTU Library (https://findit.dtu.dk/), or material added to the DTU Learn course group.\nMain textbook:\nElectrochemical Engineering, T.F. Fuller, J.N. Harb, Wiley, 2018. ISBN: 978-1-119-00425-7",
    "Remarks": "For PhD students, it will be possible to adjust the course to enable registration as a PhD special course. Contact the course responsible for more information (at least a week) before the start of the course.\nIf you wish to proceed with further studies of electrochemistry and more advanced electrochemical methods, you can continue with course 47514, Advanced electrochemistry.",
