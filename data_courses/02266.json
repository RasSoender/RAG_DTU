    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nBuilding on a briefly introduced foundation, the course guides students through project-driven hands-on applications of lean methods to UX design of e.g. \"cognitive computing\" interfaces, combining business canvas modeling with hierarchical user story mapping as a basis for agile development and validation of prototypes as minimum viable products (MVP).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify, model and validate user needs and goals for specific market segments, using an iterative hierarchical process\nDesign and validate MVP UX prototypes building upon established interface paradigms\nDesign and validate MVP UX prototypes for emerging and novel types of interfaces\nFormulate verifiable hypothesis that can guide UX Engineering decisions\nDesign methods to rapidly measure and validate such hypothesis, facilitating a data driven decision process\nIncorporate biometric measurements into MVP UX prototypes\nCreate MVP UX prototypes that adapt to the cognitive or emotional state of the user\nIdentify health-related aspects of MVP UX prototypes that can assist users in their personal life journey\nUse UX prototyping techniques to communicate with a diverse set of stakeholders\nDescribe methodologies and design principles of a digital product: Design Thinking, Transformation vs Innovation, Ethics and Bias\nDescribe (additional) key processes that are necessary when developing a digital product: Agile, Lean and Build-Measure-Learn\nDescribe additional concerns when a digital product transitions from the development phase to production: Scalability",
    "Content": "The course is focused on development of UX design prototypes of next generation interfaces like \"cognitive computing\" incorporating biometric data related to e.g. heart rate, eye tracking or emotional responses based on facial gestures.\n\nThe methods also forming the foundation of 02809 \"UX Design Prototyping\" are applied more widely into designs of \"next generation\" UX prototypes, where new and unfamiliar challenges needs to be modelled and engineered in a systematic way.",
    "Remarks": "The course is part of DTU Compute's Digital Innovation Canon.",
