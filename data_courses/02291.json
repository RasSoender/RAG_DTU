    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective of the course is to provide the participants with theoretical foundations and tool-supported methodologies to understand, model, analyze and design complex heterogeneous systems assembled from different components. The aim is to cover a holistic view of modelling techniques that contribute to explaining different dimensions of a socio-technical system including software components.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nanalyze and model the requirements of a system\nexplain a socio-technical system using model-driven frameworks\nmodel a system and its components\ndefine rules to integrate data from heterogeneous data sources\ndesign a multi-dimensional data model capable of answering analytical questions\ndesign process collaborations and process models\napply modeling techniques for domain modeling, requirements, design, and systems in a specific case\ndiscuss the appropriateness of models to explain a given problem\nachieve the above goals in a group effort while at the same time maintaining individual accountability",
    "Content": "This course covers model-based techniques to integrate the different components of a socio-technical system. In particular, the course will focus on the following problems:\n\n- how to model different views of a complex system made of multiple components\n- how to integrate data from heterogeneous sources\n- how to integrate software components\n\nSome of the techniques to address those problems include:\n- Requirements engineering techniques to specify properties of complex systems and its components\n- Modeling complex systems using enterprise architectures\n- Data models and data integration techniques\n- Choreographic and collaborative approaches to model and integrate processes",
    "Course literature": "Selected articles and book chapters will be provided online.",
