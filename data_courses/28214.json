    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo practice experimental techniques applied in common polymerization methods such as suspension, emulsion, controlled free radical or ring opening polymerization and to achieve practical experience in characterization of polymers both chemically and physically.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nConstruct standard polymerization setups on a laboratory scale\nAccount for the use of inhibitors in monomers and perform purification of monomers\nPerform suspension, emulsion, controlled free radical or ring opening polymerizations.\nConduct kinetic studies of the selected polymerization technique and apply this to obtain a desired product.\nApply and describe the principles behind standard purification techniques applied in polymer science.\nCharacterize polymers chemically by SEC, FT-IR, NMR and prove the product structure based on these techniques.\nPerform analysis and relate these to the physical properties of polymers by DSC, TGA and Rheology.\nCombine theory and experimental work to propose new systems and new polymers.\nDiscuss and present state of the art literature on a specific polymerization method.\nReflect over the performed experiments and document the experimental work in a scientific manner.\nPresent the results in a poster session.",
    "Content": "The course is divided into 2 parts, where all groups will start by preparation of linear polymers by both suspension as well as emulsion polymerization. Subsequently each group select a specialization track, where a deeper insight into common techniques can be achieved. These change from year to year, but generally covers synthetic methods for preparation of polymers/block copolymers (free radical polymerization, controlled radical polymerization, ring-opening polymerization or e.g. enzymatic polymerization). It could also be polymerization of bio-based monomers , preparation of network polymers, preparation and testing of composites as well as surface modification and characterization.\nIn all tracks the groups will work with purification and characterization of polymers. Analysis of prepared polymers by SEC, FT-IR, NMR, DSC, TGA and Rheology. Structure elucidation based on the performed analyses.\nFinally the experiments should be documented and reported in a scientific manner and presented through a poster session.",
