    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nIn the course you will learn how to use your basic knowledge of physics to analyse and design nanosystems, and to evaluate how they can be used in practice. You will learn how the different physical properties of nanostructures can be exploited to find better technological solutions.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nAccount for quantum-mechanical tunneling and analyse ultrafast field emission from nanostructures driven by intense THz fields\nCalculate mechanical and surface properties of atomically thin carbon nanomaterials and evaluate their performance in nanosensors\nDescribe the formation and applications of ferroelectric and ferroelastic domain structures\nDescribe how impedance flow cytometry can be used to gain information on cell membrane structure\nAnalyse the behaviour of DNA molecules confined in nanofluidic channels\nDescribe optothermal actuation in nanofluidic devices\nDescribe optical properties of nanostructured materials.\nAnalyse the properties of surface plasmons for sensing applications\nAnalyse nano and biosystems using data from insitu transmission electron microscopy",
    "Content": "In this course you learn about nanosystems; how they work and how they can be applied in practice.\n\nA \"nanosystem\" is a system, for which the function depends on one or more of its compnents having feature sizes in the 1-100 nanometer range. To be able to design and create a nanosystem, you will work with the physical properties of the nanostructures as well as their function when integrated in a system.\n\nThe course is closely connected to today's and future applications of nanotechnology within the key areas of (1) carbon-based nanosystems, (2) biological nanosystems, (3) nanooptical systems, (4) lightwave electronics (5) nanofluidic systems, (6) electron microscopy of nanosystems and biological materials and (7) ferroelectric/elastic nanosystems. The topic of nanosafety and nanotoxicology will also be briefly discussed.\n\nThe course is a dynamic and interactive combination of lectures, discussions, small projects and exercises, where you will be challenged in many different ways.\n\nThrough six home assignments you will work closer with the material, and familiarise yourself with sometimes complex problems and their importance for selected nanosystems.",
    "Course literature": "The course will be based on lecture notes which will be made available electronically.",
