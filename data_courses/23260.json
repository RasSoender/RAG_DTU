    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe purpose of the course is to introduce people to some of the best and most used programs to perform the initial processing of metagenomics data from raw reads to mapping, abundance and taxonomy assignment. The focus will be that a student understands the main concept/theory that are used by the metagenomics tools but only to enhance the understanding of what is going on behind the scenes. It is not a theory course but rather a practical course mixed with a theoretical background of the programs that are used. All students will get an account at computerome where they in groups of up to 4 persons will work on a metagenome dataset that is provided. One for each group. This dataset will be the basis for the exercises and later as part of the final poster.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nOutline pros and cons for different sequence platforms\nDescribe principles in library preparation\nApply barcoding and multiplexing/de-multiplexing\nExecute and describe the process of trimming\nDescribe the process of using k-mers for reference-based mapping and alignment\nApply de novo assembly and evaluate results\nApply the abundance measures: RPKM, FPKM, ALR and CLR\nExecute and discuss the basic concept/theory of binning programs\nDiscuss the pros and cons of various binning programs and the underlying signals that can be used\nDescribe how to annotate sequence bins and apply metrics to classify according to high, medium and low quality\nCommunicate and engage in a discussion about poster results\nConduct a group study retrieving genomes from a set of public metagenomes, resulting in a poster",
    "Content": "Introduction to course\n\nSequencing, library preparation, platforms & sequence errors\n\nBasic unix, submitting jobs to computerome via PBS scripts\n\nFastq format, barcodes, demultiplexing, trimming, quality control\n\nKraken suite & Lowest common ancestor: Kraken, Kraken2 & Bracken\n\nk-mers and KMA program\n\nAbundance measures and composition data analysis\n\nDe-novo assembly with Spades, gene annnotation using Prokka and ResFinder\n\nBinning and quality measures: metabat2 & vamb\n\nHow to start the actual analysis of a dataset i.e. taxonomy annotation, checkm, GTDB-TK, mash similarity and drep.\n\nWork on own sequence data\n\nSummery of some of the most important points during the course",
