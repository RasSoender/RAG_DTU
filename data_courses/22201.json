    "Point( ECTS )": "5",
    "Course type": "MSc\nProgramme specific course (MSc), see more\n\n\n\n\nTechnological specialization course (MSc), see more\n\n\n\n\nElective course (B Eng), Fisheries Technology",
    "Schedule": "Spring F4B (Fri 8-12)",
    "Location": "Campus Lyngby",
    "Scope and form": "The course consists of lectures together with group and individual exercises; e.g. journal clubs and report writing. The course also includes a large number of lab and computer exercises.",
    "Duration of Course": "13 weeks",
    "Date of examination": "F4B",
    "Type of assessment": "Evaluation of exercises/reports\nJournal club individual test (20%), lab report (40%) and in-class test (40%). The final grade is based on an overall assessment of all part exams. Journal club individual test (20%): Group work with 4 papers covering 4 main subjects of developmental immunology. Each student will then get questions relating to each paper, which they will have to complete by the end of the semester. We will discuss the answers in the class. Written lab report (40%): we will perform 3 lab exercises covering mouse lymphoid tissue anatomy, microscopy and flow cytometry. The aim will be to solve a particular research question based on real-life data. At the end, the students will have to prepare a report based on the data they acquire In-class test (40%): the test will consist of a few simple multiple choice questions covering the lectures, in addition to a question concerning experimental design that the students will be given half way through the semester and will have the chance to prepare in advance of the test.",

    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo provide students with a detailed understanding of how cells and organs of the immune system develop and how they are organized anatomically. A large part of the course is additionally dedicated to general scientific competences including literature critiquing/reviewing (this will be done in the form of in-class Journal Clubs), experimental performance and design (3 full days of experimental work and an exercise on experimental design), data analysis and interpretation (in-class demonstration of analytical software).",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndefine and interpret the fundamental biology governing immune cell development.\ndefine and interpret the fundamental biology governing lymphoid organ anatomy and development.\ndefine and interpret the fundamental biology governing lymphocyte and stromal cell signaling.\ninterpret and critically appraise primary scientific literature individually and in group discussions.\nextract and evaluate available scientific information.\nanalyze and interpret scientific data.\npresent (orally and written) own and published scientific data.\nperform and design experiments utilizing basic immunological techniques and genetic rodent models.",
    "Content": "The topics that will be covered in this course include:\n1. The development and organization of secondary lymphoid tissues\n2. The mechanisms that sustain lymphoid and myeloid cell development in primary lymphoid tissues\n3. Developmental and stromal cell requirements of primary and secondary lymphoid tissues\n4. Molecular pathways involved in lymphoid tissue and cell development\n5. Mouse genetics and experimental models including ethics involved\n6. Basic immunological techniques: FACS and microscopy\n7. Flow cytometric analytical tools\n8. Critical analysis of scientific literature\n\nIn addition, the course is designed so that the students develop presentation, writing, experimental and analytical skills.",
