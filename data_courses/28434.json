    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo enable the students to understand the mechanisms for solute transport in different membrane types and to estimate the possibilities to use separation processes based on the application of semipermeable membranes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify and describe the main unit operations associated with membrane technology\nDescribe the main industrial applications of membrane technology.\nDerive equations for solvent and solute transport in pressure driven membrane processes.\nCalculate how concentration and eventually temperature polarisation influence the solute transport for the different membrane processes\nDescribe the main polymeric materials used for membrane synthesis\nDescribe the function of the main used membrane modules and how they are used in different membrane processes.\nCalculate mean flux, selectivity and membrane area for the different membrane processes.\nDescribe process layout and eventually pre- and post treatment in relation to the fouling problems for the different membrane processes.\nEmploy membrane technology knowledge to discuss recent journal articles in the membrane field and compare the with similar separation processes.\nDescribe current applications of membrane technology, with particular emphasis on green processes and sustainability, by including several examples of processes in which membrane technology contributes to make processes greener e.g. use in downstream processing or use of membrane enzyme reactors",
    "Content": "The course is divided into four main modules:\n1)Basics and principles: Operation modes in membrane operations. Membrane modules. Membrane materials. Mathematical models for porous and nonporous membranes. Concentration polarization and fouling. Models to describe fouling. Technical evaluation of different membrane processes compared to traditional separation processes. Main applications of membrane technology.\n2)Liquid operations: Reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration and microfiltration. Application of the basic principles to liquid operations.\n3)Gas and special operations: Gas separation, pervaporation, membrane contactors, membrane distillation, electrodialysis, membrane bioreactors.\n4)Particular applications of membrane technology: Membranes in biotechnology, membranes in the chemical industry, membranes in the food industry, membranes used as reactors, membranes in wastewater treatment.",
    "Remarks": "Scientific papers will be used as course material. The papers will be provided by the teacher. The needed books are open access (free) for DTU students\nAs the course is online, the students must have a proper computer. Cam is also mandatory.",
