    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe overall objective of the course is to provide students with the technical skills required for groundwater resources quality management. Students will gain competences in i) groundwater flow and transport processes, ii) water quality assessment including quantitative evaluation of major environmental problems due to diffuse and geogenic contamination of aquifer systems, iii) aquatic chemistry and groundwater quality, iv) calculations of geochemical equilibria and (bio)chemical reactions. Examples and problems will be selected to illustrate key theoretical issues, groundwater quality challenges and expose the students to practical groundwater quality management.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nUnderstand the principles of groundwater flow, solute transport and water abstraction\nAnalyze groundwater quality problems and relation to drinking water quality criteria\nEvaluate the impact of contamination on groundwater resources\nUnderstand the processes that determine groundwater quality, as well as the mechanisms of release and transport of groundwater contaminants\nDescribe chemical and microbiological processes, identify effects of geogenic processes and anthropogenic impacts on groundwater systems and quality\nExamine practical groundwater quality problems, and identify and apply the theory relevant to solving them\nIncorporate process understanding and observations (data) of groundwater systems into conceptual models and employ them to assist in understanding and solving groundwater quality problems\nApply calculation tools for quantitatively describing geochemical and biogeochemical processes\nReview and disseminate scientific publications about a specific groundwater quality challenge and disseminate the knowledge in a short paper and an oral presentation",
    "Content": "Topics will include: introduction to groundwater flow, reactive transport in porous media, and water abstraction. Description of biogeochemical processes including concepts of equilibrium, sorption and ion exchange, carbonate system, redox processes, major problems of groundwater contamination by diffuse pollution sources (e.g., nitrate, pesticides, PFAS and arsenic contamination), as well as application of insight into flow, transport and reactive processes to solve practical problems related to management of quality and quantity of groundwater.",
