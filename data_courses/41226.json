    "Content": "Linear and nonlinear wave theories for monochromatic waves on constant depth such as higher order Stokes theory, Second- and third-order theory for short-crested waves. Cnoidal theory and solitary wave theory. Streamfunction methods. Linear wave-current interaction including Doppler shift and blocking. Diffraction, Wave spectra and Fourier techniques. Spectral generation and Fourier analysis of the corresponding time series. Wave instabilities due to quartet-, and quintet- interactions. Introduction to wave modelling techniques in time and frequency domain.",
    "Remarks": "It is expected that the students will bring along their own laptop and have experience in using tools like Mathematica, MAPLE, MATLAB, and/or Python.",
