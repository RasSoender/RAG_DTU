    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe aim of the course is to provide the students with the necessary tools and framework for formulating and planning a project relevant to the biotech and pharmaceutical industry.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndemonstrate the ability to systematically search, retrieve and critically assess relevant scientific, patent and market literature from the internet.\nunderstand how to set timelines and define milestones, work packages and deliverables.\nplan and perform task delegation, communication and following up among group members.\npresent, explain, discuss and defend project ideas orally and in writing to group members and to decision makers.\ndescribe examples of typical real-life projects and strategies in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry.\nunderstand and explain specific formal and practical requirements for biotech and pharma-related scientific projects.\ntransform a scientific idea into a coherent research grant proposal.\nuse basic project management tools in the development of a scientific project plan.",
    "Content": "The course consists of lectures, in which we introduce the students to projects and strategy in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. The basic project management toolkit such as SWOT analysis, Gantt chart, Work Breakdown Structure and Risk Assessment will be taught. The students work in groups of 2 to 4, taking into consideration that course participants are students from different MSc lines. The students from the Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering MSc are presented with a number of real-life problems from industrial partners, from which they may choose one. Students can also define their own projects, preferentially with an industry or university partner (supervisor).\n\nStudents are asked to submit a report in the form of a research grant proposal. The report should highlight the aim of the proposed project and should describe how the students approach, delimit and plan each project phase. It is highly encouraged, but not required, that the students will continue working on the selected project throughout all modules of the integrated course. Project groups will be formed during the course based on interest and will encourage multidisciplinary collaboration.",
    "Remarks": "This course constitutes the first module of the integrated second year course on the Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering program.\nFor students on the Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering program it is mandatory to continue with Module 2 (27691).\nOther students can follow this course without continuing to Module 2.",
