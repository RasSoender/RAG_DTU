    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will enable the student to evaluate relevant microbiological and chemical hazards in food production chains.The student will relate important microorganisms to their possible roles in spoilage and diseases that can be transmitted through the food chain to humans. Furthermore the student will calculate and evaluate the occurrence of chemical hazards in foods. Through a project assignment, the student will assemble a risk assessment and fomulate a HACCP plan, which covers the raw materials, production methodologies and unit operations for a given food product.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nDescribe and analyze a food production chain with regards to potential issues of food safety and spoilage\nIdentify relevant microbiological and chemical hazards for a given food production\nIdentify steps in the production chain that are critical with regard to the hazards including current food safety legislation\nIdentify key elements of chemical risk analysis and microbiological hazard analysis\nApply chemical exposure assessment and risk characterization to a given product\nExplain food allergy and manage allergenic food in a given production\nFor a given food product create an assessment of microbiological and chemical hazards in the food production chain from farm to fork\nExplain the concept of food sampling schemes\nIdentify and evaluate potential food fraud opportunities in the raw materials and the production chain\nEstablish measures that will control the safety of the product (apply HACCP principles)\nAssemble a concise written report that covers the formulation of a risk assessment and design of a hazard control plan for a given food product",
    "Content": "The course will provide in depth coverage of current and relevant food safety issues with regards to microbiology, and chemical hazards. The course presents relevant hazards in the entire food production chain from farm to fork and includes microbiological, and chemical aspects of the risk assessment. The course will enable the students to evaluate relevant hazards in specific food production chains, to identify critical steps in the production, and to construct a hazard control plan to control or mitigate these hazards, including management of allergenic foods. The student will work with the topics through lectures, assignments, and group/project work.",
    "Remarks": "It is a prerequisite for admission to the exam, that each group submits a flow-chart and presents preliminary microbiological (alternatively chemical) results for approval of the first 1/2 part of the course (agreed date in March) and a comprehensive report on microbiological and chemical food safety for assessment as part of the examination (agreed date in May).",
