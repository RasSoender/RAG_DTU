    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course equips participants with the knowledge and tools to understand, model, and manage natural hazards in Arctic regions. Through a combination of theory, case studies and modeling exercises, students will learn how to identify hazards, assess risks, and implement operational hazard management strategies in the context of a changing environment and society.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nClassify and understand different types of natural hazards relevant to Arctic regions.\nMap hazard susceptibility using geospatial analysis.\nSimulate avalanches, debris flows and landslides with numerical tools.\nAnalyze weather systems and their role as hazard triggers.\nCalculate return periods and apply them to weather-triggered hazards\nDesign mitigation methods in relation to different hazards.\nDesign and evaluate operational early warning systems and crisis management.\nAssess the impact of societal and climate changes on hazard evolution and management.",
    "Content": "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to natural hazard management, focusing on Arctic-specific challenges. The students will gain skills in the following aspects of natural hazard management: identification, mapping, and modeling while exploring operational management and mitigation strategies.\n\nTopics:\n- Hazard Identification and Classification\n- Hazard Mapping and Modelling\n- Operational Hazard Management and mitigation\n- Evolving Natural Hazards",
    "Remarks": "The course takes place in Sisimiut, Greenland\nThe course can only be taken as part of the Arctic Semester package together with 30857, 41882, evt. also 12854 or 41881.\nThe course can be taken as a stand-alone course under Open University.\nThe course may be taken separately by students on the BEng education in Arctic Civil Engineering.\nStudents must bring their own computer, which will be used for modelling and assignments; there is no access to databar.",
