    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course will give participants deeper insight into how protein structures are being solved in 3 dimensions. Participants will gain knowledge and experience in crystallization and X-ray structure determination, as well as an understanding of which statistical methods are used as validation of protein structures. You will also gain knowledge on how to download the raw X-ray data and how to independently optimize the model with the latest structure treatment programs, such as the Coot and refinement programs Phenix.\nThe course will provide an introduction to basic structural chemical concepts as well as applications to determine the structure of proteins. Participants will after the course be able to interpret and utilize structural chemistry results and databases and have gained a thorough task-based introduction to antibiotic binding sites, rational protein redesign, protein-protein complexes and an understanding of enzymatically active sites. You will gain insight into how to write your own script for pymol. As well as insight into how the protein structure database can be used as a biochemical tool to direct biochemical experiments or form the basis for new structure-based hypotheses. The course will also describe the new possibilities that the model prediction program alphafold2 has provided for structural biology. How alphafold2 can optimize the yield of pre-existing x-ray data and how alphafold2 is used in connection with protein complexes as well as for predicting structural bioengineering of therapeutics in applied research",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nexamine and criticize the quality of an already published protein structure\naccess and download published data, for evaluation and re-refinement\ncritically evaluate and compare protein structures from the literature or databases\naccount for the building of crystalline materials in terms of symmetries and unit cells\ndescribe fundamental X-ray diffraction theory and define the reciprocal lattice and relate it to the direct lattice\nderive hypotheses for optimized protein design based on structural analysis\nperform structural comparisons and understand the consequences of differences in data quality\nset up a crystallization experiment and evaluate future experimental setups\nexplain how to solve a protein structure by the use of X-ray diffraction\nevaluate alphafold models vs crystallographic experimental models\nunderstand how alphafold models have promoted structural biology\nMaster refinement and validation of online crystallographic data",
