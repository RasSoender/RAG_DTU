    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe objective for this course is to provide the students with a network perspective overview of functions and elements as well as related standards which form the basis for the implementation of future integrated global communication networks.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify the challenges of building and scaling global communication networks\nDifferentiate between physical and logical networks\nIllustrate and compare different topologies for communication networks\nCharacterize traffic by relevant parameters\nAsses control and management systems for large networks\nDevise procedures for building networks providing high reliability\nExplain the difference between quality of service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE)\nDescribe the principles of providing sustainable communication network infrastructure\nAnalyze ongoing research in communication networks and its relation to legacy technologies\nPresent own findings in reports and oral presentations, and give constructive feedback to others",
    "Content": "The focus of the course will be on providing the students of a general understanding of the complexity of the core and transport infrastructure. It will contain topics such as network topologies, network layering and stratification, reference models, complex communication systems, transmission and multiplexing protocols and their internal relation, logical vs. physical networks, traffic characterization, network resilience, network control and management, node architecture, energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS) and Quality of Experience, and transition from legacy to next generation networks. Assignments, groupwork, peer-evaluation and presentations are an integral part of the course.\nAt an appropriate level the course will incorporate topics from ongoing research activities within the department as well as guest lecturers from Danish industry.",
