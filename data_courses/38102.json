    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course is an introduction to technology entrepreneurship. The aim of the course is to bring together students from different backgrounds, in order to develop commercialization strategies for technologies developed at DTU.\n\nThe course will introduce students to concepts, models and tools that can be used in order to: identify and evaluate market opportunities for a university technology; to develop a business case; and to effectively communicate (pitch) the business case to create interest and attract resources. The course will draw upon the fields of entrepreneurship, strategy, management and marketing. It will also provide a sustainability angle to spark the students’ interest towards the creation of SDG-oriented technology startups.\n\nThis course is relevant not only to the students who want to become entrepreneurs, but also to the ones who aspire to become the “engineers of the future” and work as innovators in established companies.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nIdentify and evaluate market opportunities for a university technology\nDevelop a strong value proposition and design an appropriate business model\nFormulate an effective market development and customer acquisition strategy based on real feedback from potential users of the proposed product offering\nDetermine financial requirements and funding sources for technology and market development\nDetermine key development (technical and market/customer) goals to achieve commercial success\nSelect an appropriate IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) protection\nCreate and present (pitch) a cohesive business plan\nApply techniques for efficient teamwork",
    "Content": "Identification and evaluation of market opportunities\nValue proposition\nBusiness models\nMarket development and customer validation\nCompetitor analysis\nFinancing technology ventures\nSources of funding\nIPR (Intellectual Property Rights)\nBusiness planning and pitching\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",

    "Remarks": "The deadline for leaving the course is end of week 1. All students, who do not wish to take the course, need to officially de-register.\n\nThe maximum number of students will depend on the number of technology cases provided by the teachers. This number will depend on the number of technologies offered by researchers at DTU, and their availability/commitment to provide support to students throughout the semester. Priority will be given to students from the MSc in Technology Entrepreneurship. 35 seats are reserved for the students of the MSc in Sustainable Energy (and for whom the course is mandatory).",
