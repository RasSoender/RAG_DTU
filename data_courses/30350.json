    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nRadar and radiometer systems are used from satellites and aircrafts to measure and monitor the surface of the Earth, including the land surfaces, the oceans and the atmosphere. This is called remote sensing or Earth observation and is of utmost importance for monitoring the Earth’s environment and climate.\n\nThe general course objectives are to provide the students with an understanding of those radar and radiometer techniques and systems that are used for remote sensing, with a special emphasis on the technical description of the sensors and on the application of these techniques for measuring and monitoring of properties of the surface of the Earth. This also includes knowledge about the necessary data processing techniques.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nanalyse the interaction of electromagnetic waves with surface and volume scatterers\nanalyse the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique and discuss its applications\nanalyse the interferometric SAR technique and discuss its applications\ndescribe the polarimetric SAR interferometry technique\nanalyse the radar altimeter and wind scatterometer techniques and discuss their ocean applications\nanalyse and compare microwave radiometer techniques\ndiscuss applications of microwave radiometers including the estimation of ocean salinity and soil moisture, and the monitoring of sea ice\nimplement a data processing method and interpret the results\nplan and perform project work\nwrite a technical report.",
    "Content": "The course includes a survey with application examples of sensors like side-looking radar, radar altimeter, wind scatterometer, and radiometer. Applications are primarily within oceanography, including sea pollution, glaciology, including sea ice, mapping, farming, and forestry. The course includes a description of the techniques for each of the above-mentioned sensors, the relevant applications with examples, and discussions about the necessary data processing and interpretation methods.\n\nThe course is directly related to the remote sensing research developed at DTU Space through more than 30 years, and provides students with competencies relevant to UN SDGs, particularly #13 (Climate Action) and #15 (Life on land).",
    "Remarks": "The course is closely related to 30340 Radar and Radiometer Systems.",
