    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to equip students with (1) a knowledge base on the major biochemical, physical and chemical processes applicable to traditional and novel wastewater treatment and resource recovery (WWTRR); (2) an understanding of how these processes are organized in a full-scale WWTRR facility; (3) an ability to design and retrofit a WWTRR facility based on different performance indicators; (4) the competence to perform process design and analysis for the major WWTRR unit operations, via appropriate steady-state computations or the use of dynamic process simulation; (5) an ability to select appropriate mathematical models, apply them and interpret their results for full-scale WWTRR facility operation.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nCharacterize wastewater flows in terms of quantity and quality, with focus on the different wastewater fractions\nExplain the processes involved in biological removal/recovery of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous\nIdentify and discuss the different components of a full-scale WWTRR facility and outline treatment trains and mass flows within the system\nDescribe the different concepts and technologies for conventional and innovative wastewater treatment and resource recovery\nCharacterize and design processes for (bio)solid/liquid separation\nDifferentiate conventional control rules and apply them for WWTRR plant optimization based on different performance indicators\nDiscuss emerging concerns in WWTRR and select the appropriate technologies or operational strategies to address them\nSupport the adaptation of WWTRR facilities to cope with industrial wastewater treatment\nObtain and evaluate empirical data from laboratory experiments\nRecognize and apply mathematical models for design of removal processes in a WWTRR facility\nReport results from laboratory experiments and model simulations both in scientific reports and a professional engineering report.",
    "Content": "The course provides a complete overview of the processes, concepts and technologies used for wastewater treatment and resource recovery (WWTRR). The course focuses on the biological processes involved in the removal/recovery of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous, along with (bio)solid/liquid separation processes. Focus is given to alternate treatment trains and plant configurations to achieve different environmental objectives and performance indicators (e.g. energy demand, greenhouse gas emissions, or recovery and valorization of different resources).Overview of current treatment technologies and control practices will address daily operation and optimization in traditional plants. An insight into new trends and emerging concerns in wastewater treatment will provide the students with tools to face future challenges and design sustainable treatment strategies. Guidelines for upgrading WWTPs for industrial wastewater treatment will be provided. In terms of practical activities, the course includes laboratory experiments to characterize wastewater components, and to evaluate biochemical and settling behavior of biomass, and modelling exercises to design, operate and retrofit a WWTRR plant. The state-of-the-art WWTP modelling tool WEST is used throughout the course.",
