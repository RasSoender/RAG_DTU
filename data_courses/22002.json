    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThe course aims to provide experience in measurement and analysis methods that are used in audiological clinics and in hearing research. The aim is furthermore to train the participants in oral presentations of scientific material and to produce, present, and discuss a poster.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndesign and conduct an experiment in the field of hearing science.\ncollect audiological data on human subjects.\nanalyze those data using simple statistical tools.\ncompare the results of the research project with supplied current literature.\nsummarise and evaluate the results of the research project by producing and presenting a poster.\ncommunicate the project results to a non-specialist audience.\nexplain and discuss the principles behind standardized clinical measures in audiology such as speech intelligibility, auditory evoked potentials, and otoacoustic emissions.\nformulate a testable hypothesis.\nformulate a statistical model.",
    "Content": "Each year, four new small research projects in the field of audiology will be proposed. First, the students will be familiarized with those projects through some exercises. Then the students will be divided into groups and assigned to one of these projects. Each group, under the supervision of one PhD student, will have to design an experiment, collect some data and analyze the result to test a specific hypothesis related to the project. Finally, they will learn to present their findings to their peers during a poster session.",
    "Remarks": "The contents of the course will be adapted from year to year to utilize the available measurement equipment.",
