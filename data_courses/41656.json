    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nThis course aims to develop comprehensive knowledge on how to select materials for a wide range of constructions and products in engineering applications. Following this course, the students will have a deep understanding of: a) the methodology of materials selection b) use of computer-aided selection, c) importance of materials for sustainability, and d) material data and knowledge sources and their usefulness. At the end of the course, the students will learn to implement constructions/designs based on appropriate and sustainable material selection from a variety of choices available to them.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\ndescribe general material properties and their relation to product and component design\noutline a methodology for selecting materials for engineering applications\nclassify function, material, shape, processes, economic, and environmental factors in material selection\nassess materials for multiple constraints and conflicting objectives\nemploy computer aided material selection\nimplement constructions/design based on proper material selection\nformulate current materials selection in important technological applications\ninterpret structured information on materials and materials processes\nevaluate materials and environment relationships, and analyze importance of materials for sustainable design",
    "Content": "This course will cover the following aspects:\n• Importance of materials, processes, and mechanical factors, and environmental/sustainability aspects in construction/design, e.g. for a specific application such as car body, how the performance of the car depends on above mentioned factors.\n• How to select materials for a specific application depending on the property and performance needed for construction. A generalized material selection strategy will be introduced together with use of material property charts, computer-aided selection, and case studies.\n• How to find structured information on materials and processes for material selection? How to screen information on materials and arrive at a conclusion? How to create hybrid materials with combined properties of two or three materials?\n• Component/structural failures due to improper materials choice and bad construction - case studies. Detailed survey of typical real life examples of failures from different applications – lectures and videos.\n\n• Present material scenario, performance requirements, and future trends in important technological sectors:\n\n- Transportation\n- Microelectronics\n- Bio-medical\n- Building\n- Packaging\n- High temperature\n- Industrial applications\n\nThe course includes few guest lectures by experts who have Industrial and Commercial experience in various aspects. These lectures will be conducted either in person or by webinar using an internet platform.\n\nThe course will have short projects to identify suitable material combinations for a particular application using material selection strategy.",
