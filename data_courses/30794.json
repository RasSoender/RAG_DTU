    "General course objectives": "General course objectives\nTo give the students a working knowledge of astronomical data acquisition, analysis, and scientific exploitation. The course will train students in using professional software and tools to analyze real astronomical data from a series of different wavelengths and telescopes.",
    "Learning objectives": "A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nuse a computer with the Linux command line system and shell-scripts\nsearch through scientific databases and archives for specific instrument data\nperform scientific analysis of astronomical data across the electromagnetic spectrum\nreduce X-ray, optical, millimeter wavelength and radio data\nexamine astrophysical data with dedicated methods and tools\nassess data quality from a statistical perspective\nexploit observation products such as images, light-curves, and spectra\nutilize fitting techniques to apply a model or mathematical function to data\nsolve real astrophysical problems and tailored exercises\ninterpret, evaluate and describe the results",
    "Content": "The course will start with an introduction to the use of Linux systems, followed by basic knowledge about astronomical detectors, calibration, measurement significance, and noise sources. The participants will be trained in reducing imaging and spectroscopic data and perform photometry. The students will learn about single-dish and interferometric observations at millimetre and radio wavelengths and will get to reduce and analyze continuum and spectroscopic data. X-ray data from currently flying X-ray instruments (e.g. NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, NICER) will be provided. All lectures will be followed by hands-on exercises based on the methods and techniques described during the lectures. Example applications include analyzing the spectra of galaxies and supernova explosions, applying techniques to find exoplanets, measuring the molecular content of distant galaxies, and studying thermonuclear explosions on neutron stars.",
